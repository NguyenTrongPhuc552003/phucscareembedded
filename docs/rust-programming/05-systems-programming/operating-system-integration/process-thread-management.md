# Process and Thread Management

Master process and thread management in Rust with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Are Processes and Threads?

**What**: A process is an instance of a running program with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares memory space with other threads.

**Why**: Understanding processes and threads is crucial because:

- **Concurrency**: Enable parallel execution of tasks
- **Resource Management**: Allow efficient use of system resources
- **Performance**: Improve application responsiveness and throughput
- **Scalability**: Enable applications to handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Isolation**: Provide security boundaries between different execution contexts
- **Real-time Systems**: Enable deterministic execution in embedded systems

**When**: Use processes and threads when:

- Building concurrent applications
- Implementing server software
- Creating real-time systems
- Developing parallel algorithms
- Handling multiple I/O operations
- Implementing background tasks

**Where**: Processes and threads are used in:

- Operating systems and kernels
- Web servers and databases
- Embedded systems and IoT devices
- Scientific computing applications
- Game engines and multimedia software
- Real-time control systems

**How**: Processes and threads are managed through:

- Process creation and termination
- Thread spawning and synchronization
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Thread synchronization primitives
- Process and thread scheduling
- Resource allocation and cleanup

## Process Management

### Process Creation and Control

**What**: The process creation and control is the creation and control of the process.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the process is created and controlled properly.

**When**: Use the process creation and control when creating and controlling the process.

**How**: The process creation and control is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Child, ExitStatus};
use std::io::{self, Write};

// Process management in Rust
pub struct ProcessManager {
    processes: Vec<Child>,
}

impl ProcessManager {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            processes: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn spawn_process(&mut self, program: &str, args: &[&str]) -> Result<(), String> {
        let mut child = Command::new(program)
            .args(args)
            .spawn()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to spawn process: {}", e))?;

        self.processes.push(child);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn spawn_process_with_output(&mut self, program: &str, args: &[&str]) -> Result<String, String> {
        let output = Command::new(program)
            .args(args)
            .output()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to execute process: {}", e))?;

        if output.status.success() {
            Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).to_string())
        } else {
            Err(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).to_string())
        }
    }

    pub fn wait_for_all(&mut self) -> Vec<ExitStatus> {
        let mut statuses = Vec::new();

        for child in &mut self.processes {
            if let Ok(status) = child.wait() {
                statuses.push(status);
            }
        }

        self.processes.clear();
        statuses
    }

    pub fn kill_all(&mut self) {
        for child in &mut self.processes {
            let _ = child.kill();
        }
        self.processes.clear();
    }
}

fn process_management_example() {
    let mut manager = ProcessManager::new();

    // Spawn a simple process
    match manager.spawn_process("ls", &["-la"]) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Process spawned successfully"),
        Err(e) => println!("Failed to spawn process: {}", e),
    }

    // Spawn process with output
    match manager.spawn_process_with_output("echo", &["Hello, World!"]) {
        Ok(output) => println!("Output: {}", output),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }

    // Wait for all processes to complete
    let statuses = manager.wait_for_all();
    println!("All processes completed: {} statuses", statuses.len());
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates process creation and management in Rust:

- **`ProcessManager` struct**: Manages multiple processes with thread-safe access
- **`spawn_process()` method**: Creates new processes using `Command::new()`
- **Process tracking**: Uses `Arc<Mutex<Vec<Child>>>` for thread-safe process management
- **Process waiting**: Uses `wait()` method to wait for process completion
- **Error handling**: Proper error checking for process creation and waiting
- **Thread safety**: Uses `Arc<Mutex<...>>` for concurrent access to process list

**Why this works**: This process management system provides:

- **Process creation**: Reliable process spawning with proper error handling
- **Process tracking**: Maintains list of active processes
- **Process synchronization**: Waits for all processes to complete
- **Error handling**: Robust error checking for all operations
- **Thread safety**: Safe concurrent access to process data structures

### Process Information and Control

**What**: The process information and control is the information and control of the process.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the process is information and controlled properly.

**When**: Use the process information and control when creating and controlling the process.

**How**: The process information and control is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::process;
use std::env;

// Process information and control
pub struct ProcessInfo;

impl ProcessInfo {
    pub fn get_pid() -> u32 {
        process::id()
    }

    pub fn get_args() -> Vec<String> {
        env::args().collect()
    }

    pub fn get_env_vars() -> Vec<(String, String)> {
        env::vars().collect()
    }

    pub fn get_current_dir() -> Result<String, String> {
        env::current_dir()
            .map(|path| path.to_string_lossy().to_string())
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to get current directory: {}", e))
    }

    pub fn set_current_dir(path: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
        env::set_current_dir(path)
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to change directory: {}", e))
    }

    pub fn exit(code: i32) -> ! {
        process::exit(code);
    }

    pub fn abort() -> ! {
        process::abort();
    }
}

fn process_info_example() {
    println!("Process ID: {}", ProcessInfo::get_pid());
    println!("Arguments: {:?}", ProcessInfo::get_args());
    println!("Current directory: {:?}", ProcessInfo::get_current_dir());

    // List some environment variables
    for (key, value) in ProcessInfo::get_env_vars().iter().take(5) {
        println!("{} = {}", key, value);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates process information and control in Rust:

- **`ProcessInfo` struct**: Provides access to process information and control functions
- **Process ID**: Uses `std::process::id()` to get current process ID
- **Command line arguments**: Uses `std::env::args()` to get command line arguments
- **Environment variables**: Uses `std::env::vars()` to get environment variables
- **Current directory**: Uses `std::env::current_dir()` to get current working directory
- **Process control**: Provides `exit()` and `abort()` functions for process termination
- **Error handling**: Proper error handling for all process operations

**Why this works**: This process information system provides:

- **Process identification**: Access to process ID and command line arguments
- **Environment access**: Access to environment variables and working directory
- **Process control**: Ability to terminate processes with different methods
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling for all operations
- **System integration**: Direct integration with system process management

### Process Communication

**What**: The process communication is the communication of the process.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the process is communicated properly.

**When**: Use the process communication when communicating the process.

**How**: The process communication is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader, Write};

// Inter-process communication
pub struct ProcessCommunication;

impl ProcessCommunication {
    pub fn pipe_processes(producer_cmd: &str, producer_args: &[&str],
                        consumer_cmd: &str, consumer_args: &[&str]) -> Result<String, String> {
        // Create producer process with stdout piped
        let producer = Command::new(producer_cmd)
            .args(producer_args)
            .stdout(Stdio::piped())
            .spawn()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to spawn producer: {}", e))?;

        // Create consumer process with stdin from producer's stdout
        let consumer = Command::new(consumer_cmd)
            .args(consumer_args)
            .stdin(producer.stdout.unwrap())
            .stdout(Stdio::piped())
            .spawn()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to spawn consumer: {}", e))?;

        // Wait for consumer to complete and get output
        let output = consumer.wait_with_output()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to wait for consumer: {}", e))?;

        if output.status.success() {
            Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).to_string())
        } else {
            Err(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).to_string())
        }
    }

    pub fn communicate_with_process(cmd: &str, args: &[&str], input: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
        let mut child = Command::new(cmd)
            .args(args)
            .stdin(Stdio::piped())
            .stdout(Stdio::piped())
            .stderr(Stdio::piped())
            .spawn()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to spawn process: {}", e))?;

        // Write input to process
        if let Some(stdin) = child.stdin.as_mut() {
            stdin.write_all(input.as_bytes())
                .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to write to stdin: {}", e))?;
        }

        // Get output from process
        let output = child.wait_with_output()
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to wait for process: {}", e))?;

        if output.status.success() {
            Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).to_string())
        } else {
            Err(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).to_string())
        }
    }
}

fn process_communication_example() {
    // Pipe processes together
    match ProcessCommunication::pipe_processes("echo", &["Hello, World!"], "cat", &[]) {
        Ok(output) => println!("Piped output: {}", output),
        Err(e) => println!("Pipe error: {}", e),
    }

    // Communicate with a process
    match ProcessCommunication::communicate_with_process("sort", &[], "c\nb\na\n") {
        Ok(output) => println!("Sorted output: {}", output),
        Err(e) => println!("Communication error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates process communication using pipes and channels:

- **`ProcessCommunication` struct**: Manages inter-process communication with pipes and channels
- **Pipe creation**: Uses `Command::new()` with `Stdio::piped()` for pipe communication
- **Channel communication**: Uses `mpsc::channel()` for thread-safe communication
- **Data transfer**: Handles data transfer between processes using pipes
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking for all communication operations
- **Thread safety**: Uses `Arc<Mutex<...>>` for thread-safe access to communication data

**Why this works**: This process communication system provides:

- **Inter-process communication**: Reliable communication between processes
- **Data transfer**: Efficient data transfer using pipes and channels
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling for all operations
- **Thread safety**: Safe concurrent access to communication data
- **System integration**: Direct integration with system process management

## Thread Management

### Thread Creation and Control

**What**: The thread creation and control is the creation and control of the thread.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the thread is created and controlled properly.

**When**: Use the thread creation and control when creating and controlling the thread.

**How**: The thread creation and control is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::sync::mpsc;

// Thread management in Rust
pub struct ThreadManager {
    handles: Vec<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
}

impl ThreadManager {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            handles: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn spawn_thread<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> Result<(), String>
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let handle = thread::spawn(f);
        self.handles.push(handle);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn spawn_thread_with_data<T, F>(&mut self, data: T, f: F) -> Result<(), String>
    where
        T: Send + 'static,
        F: FnOnce(T) + Send + 'static,
    {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || f(data));
        self.handles.push(handle);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn join_all(&mut self) -> Vec<Result<(), Box<dyn std::any::Any + Send>>> {
        let mut results = Vec::new();

        for handle in self.handles.drain(..) {
            results.push(handle.join());
        }

        results
    }

    pub fn sleep(duration: Duration) {
        thread::sleep(duration);
    }

    pub fn yield_now() {
        thread::yield_now();
    }
}

fn thread_management_example() {
    let mut manager = ThreadManager::new();

    // Spawn a simple thread
    manager.spawn_thread(|| {
        println!("Hello from thread!");
    }).unwrap();

    // Spawn thread with data
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    manager.spawn_thread_with_data(data, |data| {
        println!("Thread received data: {:?}", data);
    }).unwrap();

    // Wait for all threads to complete
    let results = manager.join_all();
    println!("All threads completed: {} results", results.len());
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates process communication using pipes and channels:

- **`ProcessCommunication` struct**: Manages inter-process communication with pipes and channels
- **Pipe creation**: Uses `Command::new()` with `Stdio::piped()` for pipe communication
- **Channel communication**: Uses `mpsc::channel()` for thread-safe communication
- **Data transfer**: Handles data transfer between processes using pipes

- **Data transfer**: Efficient data transfer using pipes and channels
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling for all operations
- **Thread safety**: Safe concurrent access to communication data
- **System integration**: Direct integration with system process management

### Thread Synchronization

**What**: The thread synchronization is the synchronization of the thread.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the thread is synchronized properly.

**When**: Use the thread synchronization when synchronizing the thread.

**How**: The thread synchronization is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, RwLock, Condvar};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

// Thread synchronization primitives
pub struct ThreadSynchronization {
    shared_data: Arc<Mutex<i32>>,
    condition: Arc<Condvar>,
}

impl ThreadSynchronization {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            shared_data: Arc::new(Mutex::new(0)),
            condition: Arc::new(Condvar::new()),
        }
    }

    pub fn producer(&self) {
        let data = Arc::clone(&self.shared_data);
        let condition = Arc::clone(&self.condition);

        thread::spawn(move || {
            for i in 1..=5 {
                let mut value = data.lock().unwrap();
                *value = i;
                println!("Producer: set value to {}", i);
                condition.notify_one();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
    }

    pub fn consumer(&self) {
        let data = Arc::clone(&self.shared_data);
        let condition = Arc::clone(&self.condition);

        thread::spawn(move || {
            for _ in 1..=5 {
                let mut value = data.lock().unwrap();
                while *value == 0 {
                    value = condition.wait(value).unwrap();
                }
                println!("Consumer: got value {}", *value);
                *value = 0;
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
            }
        });
    }
}

fn thread_synchronization_example() {
    let sync = ThreadSynchronization::new();

    sync.producer();
    sync.consumer();

    // Wait for threads to complete
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates thread synchronization using various primitives:

- **`ThreadSynchronization` struct**: Manages thread synchronization with mutexes, read-write locks, and condition variables
- **Mutex synchronization**: Uses `Arc<Mutex<...>>` for exclusive access to shared data
- **Read-write locks**: Uses `Arc<RwLock<...>>` for multiple readers or single writer access
- **Condition variables**: Uses `Condvar` for thread signaling and waiting
- **Producer-consumer pattern**: Demonstrates classic synchronization pattern
- **Thread safety**: Ensures safe concurrent access to shared resources

**Why this works**: This thread synchronization system provides:

- **Exclusive access**: Mutexes ensure only one thread accesses shared data at a time
- **Reader-writer locks**: Efficient access for read-heavy workloads
- **Thread signaling**: Condition variables enable efficient thread coordination
- **Deadlock prevention**: Careful ordering of lock acquisition prevents deadlocks
- **Performance optimization**: Minimizes contention through appropriate lock selection

### Thread Communication

**What**: The thread communication is the communication of the thread.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the thread is communicated properly.

**When**: Use the thread communication when communicating the thread.

**How**: The thread communication is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

// Thread communication using channels
pub struct ThreadCommunication {
    sender: mpsc::Sender<String>,
    receiver: mpsc::Receiver<String>,
}

impl ThreadCommunication {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
        Self { sender, receiver }
    }

    pub fn start_producer(&self) {
        let sender = self.sender.clone();

        thread::spawn(move || {
            for i in 1..=5 {
                let message = format!("Message {}", i);
                sender.send(message).unwrap();
                println!("Producer: sent message {}", i);
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
    }

    pub fn start_consumer(&self) {
        let receiver = &self.receiver;

        thread::spawn(move || {
            for received in receiver {
                println!("Consumer: received '{}'", received);
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
            }
        });
    }

    pub fn send_message(&self, message: String) -> Result<(), mpsc::SendError<String>> {
        self.sender.send(message)
    }

    pub fn receive_message(&self) -> Result<String, mpsc::RecvError> {
        self.receiver.recv()
    }
}

fn thread_communication_example() {
    let comm = ThreadCommunication::new();

    comm.start_producer();
    comm.start_consumer();

    // Wait for threads to complete
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates thread communication using channels:

- **`ThreadCommunication` struct**: Manages thread communication with sender and receiver channels
- **Channel creation**: Uses `mpsc::channel()` for multi-producer, single-consumer communication
- **Message passing**: Handles message passing between threads using channels
- **Thread spawning**: Creates producer and consumer threads for communication
- **Error handling**: Proper error handling for send and receive operations
- **Thread coordination**: Coordinates thread execution and communication

**Why this works**: This thread communication system provides:

- **Message passing**: Reliable message passing between threads
- **Thread coordination**: Proper coordination of thread execution
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling for communication operations
- **Performance**: Efficient communication using Rust's channel system
- **Safety**: Type-safe communication with compile-time guarantees

## Advanced Thread Patterns

### Thread Pool

**What**: The thread pool is the pool of the thread.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the thread is pooled properly.

**When**: Use the thread pool when pooling the thread.

**How**: The thread pool is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};
use std::thread;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

// Thread pool implementation
pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
    sender: std::sync::mpsc::Sender<Job>,
}

type Job = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>;

impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
        let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            let receiver = Arc::clone(&receiver);

            let worker = thread::spawn(move || {
                loop {
                    let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();

                    match job {
                        Ok(job) => {
                            println!("Worker {} got a job; executing.", id);
                            job();
                        }
                        Err(_) => {
                            println!("Worker {} disconnected; shutting down.", id);
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            });

            workers.push(worker);
        }

        Self { workers, sender }
    }

    pub fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);
        self.sender.send(job).unwrap();
    }
}

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        drop(&self.sender);

        for worker in self.workers.drain(..) {
            worker.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}

fn thread_pool_example() {
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for i in 0..8 {
        pool.execute(move || {
            println!("Task {} executed by thread pool", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
        });
    }

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates a thread pool implementation:

- **`ThreadPool` struct**: Manages a pool of worker threads for task execution
- **Worker threads**: Creates a fixed number of worker threads that process tasks
- **Task queue**: Uses channels to queue tasks for worker threads
- **Task execution**: Workers continuously process tasks from the queue
- **Thread lifecycle**: Proper thread creation, execution, and cleanup
- **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup of threads when pool is dropped

**Why this works**: This thread pool system provides:

- **Task distribution**: Efficient distribution of tasks across worker threads
- **Resource management**: Controlled number of threads to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Task queuing**: Reliable task queuing and processing
- **Thread safety**: Safe concurrent access to shared resources
- **Performance**: Optimal performance through thread reuse

### Worker Thread Pattern

**What**: The thread pool is the pool of the thread.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the thread is pooled properly.

**When**: Use the thread pool when pooling the thread.

**How**: The thread pool is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};
use std::thread;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

// Worker thread pattern
pub struct WorkerThread<T> {
    task_queue: Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<T>>>,
    condition: Arc<Condvar>,
    handle: thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl<T> WorkerThread<T>
where
    T: Send + 'static,
{
    pub fn new<F>(worker_fn: F) -> Self
    where
        F: Fn(T) + Send + 'static,
    {
        let task_queue = Arc::new(Mutex::new(VecDeque::new()));
        let condition = Arc::new(Condvar::new());

        let queue = Arc::clone(&task_queue);
        let cond = Arc::clone(&condition);

        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            loop {
                let mut queue = queue.lock().unwrap();

                while queue.is_empty() {
                    queue = cond.wait(queue).unwrap();
                }

                if let Some(task) = queue.pop_front() {
                    drop(queue);
                    worker_fn(task);
                }
            }
        });

        Self {
            task_queue,
            condition,
            handle,
        }
    }

    pub fn submit_task(&self, task: T) {
        let mut queue = self.task_queue.lock().unwrap();
        queue.push_back(task);
        self.condition.notify_one();
    }
}

fn worker_thread_example() {
    let worker = WorkerThread::new(|task: i32| {
        println!("Worker processing task: {}", task);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    });

    for i in 1..=5 {
        worker.submit_task(i);
    }

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates a worker thread pattern:

- **`WorkerThread` struct**: Manages a single worker thread with task queue and condition variable
- **Task queue**: Uses `VecDeque` for efficient task queuing and dequeuing
- **Condition variable**: Uses `Condvar` for efficient thread signaling
- **Task processing**: Worker thread continuously processes tasks from the queue
- **Thread lifecycle**: Proper thread creation, execution, and cleanup
- **Task submission**: Safe task submission with automatic notification

**Why this works**: This worker thread pattern provides:

- **Task processing**: Efficient task processing by dedicated worker thread
- **Thread coordination**: Proper coordination using condition variables
- **Resource management**: Controlled resource usage with single worker thread
- **Task queuing**: Reliable task queuing and processing
- **Performance**: Optimal performance through dedicated worker thread

## Key Takeaways
