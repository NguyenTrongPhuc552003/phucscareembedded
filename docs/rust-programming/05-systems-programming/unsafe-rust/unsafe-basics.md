# Unsafe Rust Basics

Master unsafe Rust programming with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is Unsafe Rust?

**What**: Unsafe Rust is a subset of Rust that allows you to bypass certain safety guarantees to perform operations that the compiler cannot verify as safe, such as dereferencing raw pointers, calling unsafe functions, or accessing mutable static variables.

**Why**: Unsafe Rust is necessary because:

- **Systems Programming**: Low-level operations require direct memory manipulation
- **Performance**: Some operations are only possible with unsafe code
- **FFI Integration**: Interfacing with C libraries requires unsafe operations
- **Hardware Access**: Direct hardware manipulation needs unsafe code
- **Optimization**: Certain optimizations require unsafe operations
- **Legacy Code**: Interfacing with existing unsafe codebases

**When**: Use unsafe Rust when:

- Working with raw pointers and memory addresses
- Calling C functions from Rust
- Implementing performance-critical algorithms
- Accessing hardware registers
- Creating safe abstractions over unsafe code
- Working with uninitialized memory

**Where**: Unsafe Rust is used in:

- Operating system kernels and drivers
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- High-performance libraries and frameworks
- FFI bindings and C interop
- Game engines and graphics programming
- Database systems and file systems

**How**: Unsafe Rust is implemented through:

- Unsafe blocks and functions
- Raw pointers and dereferencing
- Unsafe traits and implementations
- Memory manipulation operations
- FFI declarations and calls

## Unsafe Operations

### Unsafe Blocks

**What**: The unsafe blocks are the blocks of the unsafe.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the unsafe is properly blocked.

**When**: Use the unsafe blocks when blocking the unsafe.

**How**: The unsafe blocks are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
fn unsafe_basics() {
    let mut x = 42;
    let y = &x as *const i32;

    // Unsafe block allows dereferencing raw pointers
    unsafe {
        println!("Value through raw pointer: {}", *y);

        // Modify through raw pointer
        let z = &mut x as *mut i32;
        *z = 100;
        println!("Modified value: {}", x);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates basic unsafe operations:

- **`&x as *const i32`**: Creates an immutable raw pointer from a reference. Raw pointers can be null, dangling, or point to uninitialized memory
- **`unsafe { ... }`**: The unsafe block allows dereferencing raw pointers, which is normally forbidden
- **`*y`**: Dereferences the raw pointer to access the value (unsafe operation)
- **`&mut x as *mut i32`**: Creates a mutable raw pointer for modification
- **`*z = 100`**: Modifies the value through the raw pointer

**Why this is unsafe**: Raw pointers don't have the same safety guarantees as references. The compiler cannot verify that the pointer is valid, not null, or that the memory hasn't been freed.

### Raw Pointers

**What**: The raw pointers are the pointers of the raw.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the raw is properly pointed.

**When**: Use the raw pointers when pointing the raw.

**How**: The raw pointers are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
fn raw_pointers_example() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Create raw pointers
    let ptr = data.as_mut_ptr();
    let len = data.len();

    unsafe {
        // Access elements through raw pointer
        for i in 0..len {
            let element = *ptr.add(i);
            println!("Element {}: {}", i, element);
        }

        // Modify elements
        for i in 0..len {
            *ptr.add(i) *= 2;
        }
    }

    println!("Modified data: {:?}", data);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates working with raw pointers to access and modify vector elements:

- **`data.as_mut_ptr()`**: Gets a mutable raw pointer to the first element of the vector
- **`ptr.add(i)`**: Pointer arithmetic - adds `i` to the pointer to get the address of the `i`-th element
- **`*ptr.add(i)`**: Dereferences the pointer to access the element value
- **`*ptr.add(i) *= 2`**: Modifies the element through the raw pointer

**Why this is useful**: Raw pointer arithmetic can be faster than bounds-checked access in performance-critical code. However, it's unsafe because there's no guarantee that the pointer is valid or that the memory hasn't been moved or freed.

### Unsafe Functions

**What**: The unsafe functions are the functions of the unsafe.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the unsafe is properly functioned.

**When**: Use the unsafe functions when functioning the unsafe.

**How**: The unsafe functions are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
// Unsafe function declaration
unsafe fn dangerous_operation(ptr: *mut i32, value: i32) {
    if !ptr.is_null() {
        *ptr = value;
    }
}

// Safe wrapper around unsafe function
fn safe_wrapper(data: &mut i32, value: i32) {
    unsafe {
        dangerous_operation(data as *mut i32, value);
    }
}

fn unsafe_functions_example() {
    let mut x = 42;
    safe_wrapper(&mut x, 100);
    println!("Value after unsafe operation: {}", x);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use unsafe functions:

- **`dangerous_operation`**: The unsafe function that modifies the value
- **`safe_wrapper`**: The safe wrapper for the unsafe function
- **`x`**: The value to modify

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use unsafe functions. The `safe_wrapper` function wraps the unsafe function in a safe interface, handling the error cases.

## Memory Manipulation

### Uninitialized Memory

**What**: The uninitialized memory is the memory of the uninitialized.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the uninitialized is properly initialized.

**When**: Use the uninitialized memory when initializing the uninitialized.

**How**: The uninitialized memory is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::mem;

fn uninitialized_memory_example() {
    // Create uninitialized memory
    let mut uninit: [i32; 5] = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };

    // Initialize manually
    for i in 0..5 {
        uninit[i] = i as i32;
    }

    println!("Uninitialized array: {:?}", uninit);

    // Alternative: MaybeUninit
    let mut maybe_uninit: [std::mem::MaybeUninit<i32>; 5] =
        unsafe { std::mem::uninitialized() };

    for i in 0..5 {
        maybe_uninit[i] = std::mem::MaybeUninit::new(i as i32);
    }

    // Convert to initialized array
    let init: [i32; 5] = unsafe { mem::transmute(maybe_uninit) };
    println!("MaybeUninit array: {:?}", init);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use uninitialized memory:

- **`mem::uninitialized`**: Creates uninitialized memory
- **`mem::MaybeUninit`**: Creates uninitialized memory
- **`mem::transmute`**: Converts uninitialized memory to initialized memory

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use uninitialized memory. The `mem::uninitialized` function creates uninitialized memory, and the `mem::MaybeUninit` function creates uninitialized memory. The `mem::transmute` function converts uninitialized memory to initialized memory.

### Memory Copying

**What**: The memory copying is the copying of the memory.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the memory is properly copied.

**When**: Use the memory copying when copying the memory.

**How**: The memory copying is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::ptr;

fn memory_copying_example() {
    let src = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let mut dst = vec![0; 5];

    unsafe {
        // Copy memory from src to dst
        ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(
            src.as_ptr(),
            dst.as_mut_ptr(),
            src.len()
        );
    }

    println!("Copied data: {:?}", dst);

    // Move data without copying
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let ptr = data.as_mut_ptr();
    let len = data.len();
    let cap = data.capacity();

    // Forget the original vector
    mem::forget(data);

    // Reconstruct from raw parts
    let reconstructed = unsafe {
        Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, cap)
    };

    println!("Reconstructed: {:?}", reconstructed);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to copy memory:

- **`ptr::copy_nonoverlapping`**: Copies memory from one location to another
- **`src.as_ptr()`**: Gets a pointer to the source data
- **`dst.as_mut_ptr()`**: Gets a mutable pointer to the destination data
- **`src.len()`**: Gets the length of the source data

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to copy memory. The `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` function copies memory from one location to another.

### Memory Layout Manipulation

**What**: The memory layout manipulation is the manipulation of the memory layout.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the memory layout is properly manipulated.

**When**: Use the memory layout manipulation when manipulating the memory layout.

**How**: The memory layout manipulation is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::mem;

fn memory_layout_example() {
    // Transmute between types
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let y: u32 = unsafe { mem::transmute(x) };
    println!("Transmuted: {} -> {}", x, y);

    // Transmute arrays
    let bytes: [u8; 4] = [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2A];
    let value: i32 = unsafe { mem::transmute(bytes) };
    println!("Bytes to int: {:?} -> {}", bytes, value);

    // Zero-sized types
    struct Empty;
    let empty = Empty;
    let size = mem::size_of::<Empty>();
    println!("Empty struct size: {}", size);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to manipulate memory layout:

- **`mem::transmute`**: Converts between types
- **`mem::transmute`**: Converts arrays to different types
- **`mem::size_of`**: Gets the size of a type

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to manipulate memory layout. The `mem::transmute` function converts between types, and the `mem::transmute` function converts arrays to different types. The `mem::size_of` function gets the size of a type.

## Raw Pointers Deep Dive

### Pointer Arithmetic

**What**: The pointer arithmetic is the arithmetic of the pointer.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the pointer is properly arithmetic.

**When**: Use the pointer arithmetic when arithmetic the pointer.

**How**: The pointer arithmetic is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
fn pointer_arithmetic_example() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let ptr = data.as_ptr();

    unsafe {
        // Pointer arithmetic
        for i in 0..data.len() {
            let element = *ptr.add(i);
            println!("Element {}: {}", i, element);
        }

        // Offset pointers
        let offset_ptr = ptr.add(2);
        println!("Element at offset 2: {}", *offset_ptr);

        // Distance between pointers
        let distance = offset_ptr.offset_from(ptr);
        println!("Distance: {}", distance);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use pointer arithmetic:

- **`ptr.add(i)`**: Adds `i` to the pointer to get the address of the `i`-th element
- **`*ptr.add(i)`**: Dereferences the pointer to access the element value
- **`offset_from`**: Calculates the distance between two pointers

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use pointer arithmetic. The `ptr.add(i)` function adds `i` to the pointer to get the address of the `i`-th element. The `*ptr.add(i)` function dereferences the pointer to access the element value. The `offset_from` function calculates the distance between two pointers.

### Pointer Casting

**What**: The pointer casting is the casting of the pointer.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the pointer is properly casted.

**When**: Use the pointer casting when casting the pointer.

**How**: The pointer casting is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
fn pointer_casting_example() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let ptr = data.as_ptr() as *const u8;

    unsafe {
        // Cast to different types
        let int_ptr = ptr as *const i32;
        let value = *int_ptr;
        println!("First 4 bytes as i32: {}", value);

        // Cast to mutable
        let mut_ptr = ptr as *mut u8;
        // Note: This is dangerous if the original data is immutable
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use pointer casting:

- **`ptr as *const i32`**: Casts the pointer to a const pointer to `i32`
- **`ptr as *mut u8`**: Casts the pointer to a mutable pointer to `u8`

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use pointer casting. The `ptr as *const i32` function casts the pointer to a const pointer to `i32`. The `ptr as *mut u8` function casts the pointer to a mutable pointer to `u8`.

### Null Pointers

**What**: The null pointers are the pointers of the null.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the null is properly pointed.

**When**: Use the null pointers when pointing the null.

**How**: The null pointers are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
fn null_pointers_example() {
    let null_ptr: *const i32 = std::ptr::null();
    let null_mut_ptr: *mut i32 = std::ptr::null_mut();

    println!("Null pointer: {:p}", null_ptr);
    println!("Null mutable pointer: {:p}", null_mut_ptr);

    // Check for null
    if null_ptr.is_null() {
        println!("Pointer is null");
    }

    // Create non-null pointer
    let data = 42;
    let ptr = &data as *const i32;
    println!("Non-null pointer: {:p}", ptr);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use null pointers:

- **`std::ptr::null`**: Creates a null pointer
- **`std::ptr::null_mut`**: Creates a null mutable pointer
- **`is_null`**: Checks if a pointer is null

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use null pointers. The `std::ptr::null` function creates a null pointer, and the `std::ptr::null_mut` function creates a null mutable pointer. The `is_null` function checks if a pointer is null.

## Unsafe Traits

### Implementing Unsafe Traits

**What**: The unsafe traits are the traits of the unsafe.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the unsafe is properly traited.

**When**: Use the unsafe traits when traiting the unsafe.

**How**: The unsafe traits are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
// Unsafe trait
unsafe trait UnsafeTrait {
    fn dangerous_method(&self);
}

// Safe implementation
struct SafeStruct {
    data: i32,
}

unsafe impl UnsafeTrait for SafeStruct {
    fn dangerous_method(&self) {
        println!("Dangerous method called with data: {}", self.data);
    }
}

fn unsafe_traits_example() {
    let safe_struct = SafeStruct { data: 42 };
    safe_struct.dangerous_method();
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to implement unsafe traits:

- **`UnsafeTrait`**: The unsafe trait
- **`SafeStruct`**: The safe struct
- **`dangerous_method`**: The unsafe method

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to implement unsafe traits. The `UnsafeTrait` trait defines the unsafe method, and the `SafeStruct` struct implements the unsafe method.

### Send and Sync

**What**: The send and sync are the send and sync of the send and sync.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the send and sync are properly sent and synced.

**When**: Use the send and sync when sending and syncing the send and sync.

**How**: The send and sync are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::thread;

// Custom type that is not Send by default
struct NotSend {
    data: *const i32,
}

unsafe impl Send for NotSend {}

// Custom type that is not Sync by default
struct NotSync {
    data: *mut i32,
}

unsafe impl Sync for NotSync {}

fn send_sync_example() {
    let data = 42;
    let not_send = NotSend { data: &data };

    // Can now be sent between threads
    thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("NotSend in thread: {:p}", not_send.data);
    }).join().unwrap();
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use send and sync:

- **`NotSend`**: The not send struct
- **`NotSync`**: The not sync struct
- **`Send`**: The send trait
- **`Sync`**: The sync trait

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use send and sync. The `NotSend` struct implements the `Send` trait, and the `NotSync` struct implements the `Sync` trait.

## Static Variables

### Mutable Static Variables

**What**: The mutable static variables are the variables of the mutable static.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the mutable static is properly mutable.

**When**: Use the mutable static variables when mutating the mutable static.

**How**: The mutable static variables are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

// Mutable static variable
static mut COUNTER: i32 = 0;

// Thread-safe mutable static
static THREAD_SAFE_COUNTER: Mutex<i32> = Mutex::new(0);

fn static_variables_example() {
    // Unsafe access to mutable static
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += 1;
        println!("Unsafe counter: {}", COUNTER);
    }

    // Safe access to thread-safe static
    {
        let mut counter = THREAD_SAFE_COUNTER.lock().unwrap();
        *counter += 1;
        println!("Thread-safe counter: {}", *counter);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use mutable static variables:

- **`COUNTER`**: The mutable static variable
- **`THREAD_SAFE_COUNTER`**: The thread-safe mutable static variable

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use mutable static variables. The `COUNTER` variable is mutable, and the `THREAD_SAFE_COUNTER` variable is thread-safe.

### Static Functions

**What**: The static functions are the functions of the static.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the static is properly functioned.

**When**: Use the static functions when functioning the static.

**How**: The static functions are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
// Static function that can be called from C
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn rust_function(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * 2
}

// Static function with C calling convention
extern "C" fn c_function(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn static_functions_example() {
    let result = c_function(42);
    println!("C function result: {}", result);
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use static functions:

- **`rust_function`**: The static function that can be called from C
- **`c_function`**: The static function with C calling convention

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use static functions. The `rust_function` function can be called from C, and the `c_function` function can be called from Rust.

## Advanced Unsafe Patterns

### Unsafe Unions

**What**: The unsafe unions are the unions of the unsafe.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the unsafe is properly unioned.

**When**: Use the unsafe unions when unioning the unsafe.

**How**: The unsafe unions are implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
use std::mem;

// Unsafe union
union IntOrFloat {
    int: i32,
    float: f32,
}

fn unsafe_unions_example() {
    let mut union_data = IntOrFloat { int: 42 };

    unsafe {
        // Access as integer
        println!("As int: {}", union_data.int);

        // Access as float (dangerous!)
        union_data.float = 3.14;
        println!("As float: {}", union_data.float);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use unsafe unions:

- **`IntOrFloat`**: The unsafe union

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use unsafe unions. The `IntOrFloat` union can be accessed as an integer or a float.

### Unsafe Code in Safe Contexts

**What**: The unsafe code in safe contexts is the code of the unsafe in safe contexts.

**Why**: This is essential because it ensures that the unsafe in safe contexts is properly codeed.

**When**: Use the unsafe code in safe contexts when codeing the unsafe in safe contexts.

**How**: The unsafe code in safe contexts is implemented as a struct with the size and alignment of the memory block to be allocated.

```rust
// Safe function that uses unsafe internally
fn safe_string_from_raw(ptr: *const u8, len: usize) -> Option<String> {
    if ptr.is_null() || len == 0 {
        return None;
    }

    unsafe {
        // Create slice from raw parts
        let slice = std::slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len);

        // Convert to string
        std::str::from_utf8(slice)
            .ok()
            .map(|s| s.to_string())
    }
}

fn safe_unsafe_example() {
    let data = b"Hello, World!";
    let ptr = data.as_ptr();
    let len = data.len();

    if let Some(string) = safe_string_from_raw(ptr, len) {
        println!("String from raw: {}", string);
    }
}
```

**Code Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to use unsafe code in safe contexts:

- **`safe_string_from_raw`**: The safe function that uses unsafe internally
- **`safe_unsafe_example`**: The safe function that uses unsafe internally

**Why this works**: This pattern allows Rust to use unsafe code in safe contexts. The `safe_string_from_raw` function uses unsafe internally to create a string from a raw pointer. The `safe_unsafe_example` function uses unsafe internally to create a string from a raw pointer.
