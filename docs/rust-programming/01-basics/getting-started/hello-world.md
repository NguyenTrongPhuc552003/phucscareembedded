# Hello World and Basic Syntax

Master your first Rust program and understand basic syntax with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is a Hello World Program?

**What**: A "Hello, World!" program is the traditional first program that beginners write in any programming language. It demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of the language.

**Why**: Hello World programs are important because:

- **Language introduction** provides a gentle introduction to syntax and structure
- **Compilation verification** confirms that your development environment is working correctly
- **Basic concepts** introduces fundamental programming concepts like functions and output
- **Confidence building** gives you immediate success and motivation to continue learning
- **Foundation** establishes the building blocks for more complex programs

**When**: Write your first Hello World program when:

- Setting up a new development environment
- Learning a new programming language
- Testing that your Rust installation is working
- Beginning your Rust programming journey

**How**: Hello World programs work by:

- **Defining a main function** that serves as the program's entry point
- **Using output statements** to display text to the console
- **Compiling the code** into an executable program
- **Running the program** to see the output

**Where**: Hello World programs are used in all programming languages as the first step in learning, from simple scripts to complex applications.

## Your First Rust Program

**What**: The traditional "Hello, World!" program in Rust demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of Rust programs.

**Why**: This program is essential because:

- **Entry point** shows how Rust programs start execution
- **Function syntax** demonstrates how to define functions in Rust
- **Output mechanism** shows how to display text to the console
- **Macro usage** introduces Rust's powerful macro system
- **Compilation process** demonstrates how Rust code is compiled and run

**How**: Here's how to create your first Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `fn main()` defines the main function, which is the entry point of every Rust program
- `println!` is a macro (not a function) that prints text to the console with a newline
- The `!` indicates this is a macro, which is a special kind of code generation tool
- `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal that will be displayed on the console
- The semicolon `;` ends the statement
- Curly braces `{}` define the function body

**Where**: This program can be run on any system with Rust installed, and it will display "Hello, world!" on the console.

### Running the Program

**What**: There are two main ways to run Rust programs: using the compiler directly or using Cargo.

**Why**: Understanding both methods is important because:

- **Direct compilation** gives you control over the compilation process
- **Cargo workflow** provides the standard Rust development experience
- **Flexibility** allows you to choose the appropriate method for different situations
- **Learning progression** helps you understand how Rust tools work together

**How**: Here are both methods to run your program:

```bash
# Method 1: Using rustc directly
rustc main.rs
./main

# Method 2: Using cargo (recommended)
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
cargo run
```

**Explanation**:

- `rustc main.rs` compiles the source file directly into an executable
- `./main` runs the compiled executable
- `cargo new hello_world` creates a new Cargo project with proper structure
- `cd hello_world` changes to the project directory
- `cargo run` compiles and runs the project in one command
- Cargo method is recommended because it handles dependencies and project structure

**Where**: Use direct compilation for simple scripts, and Cargo for proper Rust projects with dependencies and configuration.

## Basic Syntax Rules

**What**: Rust has specific syntax rules that govern how code is written, including comments, statements, expressions, and semicolons.

**Why**: Understanding syntax rules is crucial because:

- **Code clarity** makes your programs readable and maintainable
- **Compiler requirements** ensures your code compiles successfully
- **Best practices** helps you write idiomatic Rust code
- **Team collaboration** ensures consistent code style across projects
- **Learning progression** builds the foundation for more complex concepts

**When**: Apply syntax rules when:

- Writing any Rust code
- Documenting your functions and modules
- Working with expressions and statements
- Collaborating with other developers
- Learning Rust programming concepts

### Comments

**What**: Comments are text that explains your code but is ignored by the compiler.

**Why**: Comments are valuable because:

- **Code documentation** explains what your code does and why
- **Team communication** helps other developers understand your code
- **Learning tool** helps you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the code
- **Debugging aid** helps you understand complex logic
- **Maintenance** makes it easier to modify code later

**How**: Here are the different types of comments in Rust:

```rust
// Single line comment

/*
   Multi-line comment
   Can span multiple lines
*/

/// Documentation comment
/// This is for documenting functions
fn documented_function() {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `//` creates single-line comments that explain code on the same line
- `/* */` creates multi-line comments that can span multiple lines
- `///` creates documentation comments that are used to generate documentation
- Documentation comments are processed by `rustdoc` to create HTML documentation
- Comments are ignored by the compiler and don't affect program execution
- Good comments explain the "why" behind code, not just the "what"

**Where**: Use comments throughout your code to explain complex logic, document public APIs, and provide context for future developers.

### Statements vs Expressions

**What**: Rust distinguishes between statements (which perform actions) and expressions (which evaluate to values).

**Why**: Understanding this distinction is important because:

- **Function returns** expressions can be used as return values
- **Code clarity** makes it clear when code produces values vs performs actions
- **Rust idioms** many Rust patterns rely on expressions
- **Compiler behavior** affects how the compiler processes your code
- **Learning progression** builds understanding for more advanced concepts

**How**: Here's how statements and expressions work in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Statement - performs action, returns nothing
    let x = 5;

    // Expression - evaluates to a value
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1  // No semicolon - this is an expression
    };

    println!("y = {}", y);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 5;` is a statement that creates a variable and assigns a value
- The semicolon `;` indicates this is a statement, not an expression
- `let y = { ... }` assigns the result of a block expression to y
- `x + 1` is an expression that evaluates to 4 (no semicolon)
- The block `{ let x = 3; x + 1 }` is an expression that evaluates to 4
- Expressions can be used as return values, statements cannot
- This is a fundamental concept in Rust that affects how you write code

**Where**: Use expressions when you need to return values from functions or blocks, and statements when you need to perform actions without returning values.

### Semicolons

**What**: Semicolons in Rust indicate the end of statements and distinguish between statements and expressions.

**Why**: Understanding semicolons is crucial because:

- **Statement termination** clearly marks the end of statements
- **Expression preservation** allows expressions to be used as return values
- **Compiler behavior** affects how the compiler processes your code
- **Rust idioms** many Rust patterns rely on proper semicolon usage
- **Error prevention** helps avoid common compilation errors

**How**: Here's how semicolons work in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Statement (with semicolon)
    let x = 5;

    // Expression (no semicolon)
    let y = 5;  // This is a statement

    // Function return (no semicolon)
    let z = add_one(5);
}

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1  // No semicolon - returns the value
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 5;` is a statement that ends with a semicolon
- `let y = 5;` is also a statement, even though it assigns a value
- `let z = add_one(5);` calls a function and assigns the result to z
- `x + 1` in the function has no semicolon, making it an expression that returns the value
- If you added a semicolon to `x + 1`, it would become a statement and the function would return `()`
- This is a key difference between Rust and other languages

**Where**: Use semicolons to end statements, but omit them when you want expressions to return values (like in function returns).

## Print Macros

**What**: Print macros are special code generation tools that create code to display text and data to the console.

**Why**: Print macros are essential because:

- **Output capability** allows programs to communicate with users
- **Debugging tool** helps you see what your program is doing
- **User interaction** enables programs to provide feedback and information
- **Development workflow** makes it easier to test and debug your code
- **Learning tool** helps you understand how your programs work

**When**: Use print macros when:

- Displaying information to users
- Debugging your programs
- Testing program logic
- Providing user feedback
- Learning how your code works

### println! Macro

**What**: `println!` is a macro that prints text to the console and adds a newline at the end.

**Why**: `println!` is valuable because:

- **Formatted output** allows you to display variables and data
- **Automatic newlines** makes output readable and organized
- **Flexible formatting** supports various output formats and styles
- **Debugging aid** helps you see what your program is doing
- **User communication** enables programs to interact with users

**How**: Here's how to use the `println!` macro:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic printing
    println!("Hello, world!");

    // Printing variables
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", name, age);

    // Positional arguments
    println!("{0} is {1} years old. {0} likes programming.", name, age);

    // Named arguments
    println!("{name} is {age} years old", name=name, age=age);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `println!("Hello, world!");` prints a simple string with a newline
- `println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", name, age);` uses placeholders `{}` to insert variables
- `println!("{0} is {1} years old. {0} likes programming.", name, age);` uses positional arguments
- `println!("{name} is {age} years old", name=name, age=age);` uses named arguments for clarity
- The `!` indicates this is a macro, not a function
- Macros are processed at compile time to generate the actual printing code

**Where**: Use `println!` whenever you need to display information to the console, whether for debugging, user interaction, or program output.

### Other Print Macros

**What**: Rust provides several other print macros for different output needs and debugging scenarios.

**Why**: Different print macros are useful because:

- **Output control** allows you to control when newlines are added
- **Error handling** provides separate output streams for errors
- **Debugging** makes it easier to see what your program is doing
- **Flexibility** gives you options for different output scenarios
- **Professional development** enables proper error handling and debugging

**How**: Here are the other print macros available in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // print! - no newline
    print!("Hello ");
    print!("World");
    println!(); // Add newline

    // eprintln! - print to stderr
    eprintln!("This is an error message");

    // dbg! - debug macro
    let x = 5;
    let y = dbg!(x * 2);
    println!("y = {}", y);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `print!` prints text without adding a newline, allowing multiple prints on the same line
- `println!()` with no arguments just adds a newline
- `eprintln!` prints to stderr (standard error) instead of stdout (standard output)
- `dbg!` is a debugging macro that prints the expression and its value
- `dbg!(x * 2)` prints "x \* 2 = 10" and returns the value 10
- stderr is used for error messages and debugging output
- stdout is used for normal program output

**Where**: Use `print!` for output without newlines, `eprintln!` for error messages, and `dbg!` for debugging complex expressions.

## Formatting Options

### Basic Formatting

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 42;
    let pi = 3.14159;

    // Decimal formatting
    println!("Number: {}", number);
    println!("Number: {:?}", number);  // Debug format
    println!("Number: {:#?}", number); // Pretty debug format

    // Float formatting
    println!("Pi: {:.2}", pi);        // 2 decimal places
    println!("Pi: {:.4}", pi);        // 4 decimal places
    println!("Pi: {:.0}", pi);        // No decimal places
}
```

### Advanced Formatting

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 42;
    let name = "Alice";

    // Width and alignment
    println!("|{:<10}|", name);    // Left align, width 10
    println!("|{:>10}|", name);    // Right align, width 10
    println!("|{:^10}|", name);    // Center align, width 10

    // Padding
    println!("|{:0<10}|", number); // Pad with 0s on the right
    println!("|{:0>10}|", number); // Pad with 0s on the left

    // Binary, hex, octal
    println!("Binary: {:b}", number);
    println!("Hex: {:x}", number);
    println!("Octal: {:o}", number);
}
```

## Input and Output

### Reading User Input

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("What's your name?");

    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let name = input.trim();
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

### Understanding the Input Code

```rust
use std::io;  // Import the io module

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();  // Mutable string
    io::stdin()                     // Get stdin handle
        .read_line(&mut input)      // Read into input
        .expect("Failed to read line"); // Handle potential error

    let name = input.trim();        // Remove whitespace
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

## Compilation Process

### Understanding Compilation

```bash
# What happens when you run cargo run:
# 1. Check dependencies
# 2. Compile source code
# 3. Link libraries
# 4. Run the executable
```

### Debug vs Release

```bash
# Debug build (default)
cargo build
cargo run

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

### Build Artifacts

```
target/
├── debug/           # Debug build
│   ├── hello_world  # Executable
│   └── deps/        # Dependencies
└── release/         # Release build
    ├── hello_world  # Optimized executable
    └── deps/        # Dependencies
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Compilation Errors

```rust
// Error: missing semicolon
fn main() {
    let x = 5
    println!("{}", x);
}

// Fix: add semicolon
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

### Runtime Errors

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();

    // This can panic if input is not a number
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let number: i32 = input.trim().parse().expect("Please enter a valid number");

    println!("You entered: {}", number);
}
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Personal Greeting

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("What's your name?");
    let mut name = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut name).expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("What's your age?");
    let mut age = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut age).expect("Failed to read line");

    let age: u32 = age.trim().parse().expect("Please enter a valid age");

    println!("Hello, {}! You are {} years old.", name.trim(), age);
}
```

### Exercise 2: Simple Calculator

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Enter first number:");
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let num1: f64 = input.trim().parse().expect("Please enter a valid number");

    println!("Enter second number:");
    input.clear();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let num2: f64 = input.trim().parse().expect("Please enter a valid number");

    println!("Enter operation (+, -, *, /):");
    input.clear();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let operation = input.trim();

    let result = match operation {
        "+" => num1 + num2,
        "-" => num1 - num2,
        "*" => num1 * num2,
        "/" => {
            if num2 != 0.0 {
                num1 / num2
            } else {
                println!("Error: Division by zero!");
                return;
            }
        },
        _ => {
            println!("Error: Invalid operation!");
            return;
        }
    };

    println!("Result: {} {} {} = {}", num1, operation, num2, result);
}
```
