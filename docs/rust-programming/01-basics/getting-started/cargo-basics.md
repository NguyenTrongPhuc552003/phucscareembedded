# Cargo Basics

Master Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is Cargo?

**What**: Cargo is Rust's official build system and package manager that handles all aspects of Rust project management, from compilation to dependency management.

**Why**: Cargo is essential because:

- **Unified workflow** provides a consistent experience across all Rust projects
- **Dependency management** automatically handles library downloads and updates
- **Build optimization** compiles code efficiently with appropriate settings
- **Testing integration** makes it easy to run and manage tests
- **Publishing support** enables sharing code with the Rust community
- **Project organization** maintains clean, structured codebases

**When**: Use Cargo when you need to:

- Create new Rust projects with proper structure
- Manage dependencies and external libraries
- Build, test, and run Rust applications
- Publish packages to crates.io
- Work with existing Rust projects

**How**: Cargo works by:

- **Reading Cargo.toml** to understand project configuration and dependencies
- **Resolving dependencies** by downloading required crates from crates.io
- **Compiling code** using rustc with appropriate compiler flags
- **Running tests** to verify code correctness and functionality
- **Managing artifacts** by organizing build outputs in the target directory

**Where**: Cargo is used in all Rust development workflows, from simple scripts to complex multi-crate applications.

## Creating Projects

**What**: Cargo provides commands to create new Rust projects with proper structure, configuration, and Git integration.

**Why**: Using Cargo to create projects ensures:

- **Standard structure** following Rust conventions and best practices
- **Proper configuration** with appropriate Cargo.toml settings
- **Git integration** with proper .gitignore files and repository initialization
- **Ready-to-use** projects that compile immediately
- **Consistent layout** that all Rust developers recognize

**When**: Create new projects when:

- Starting a new Rust application or library
- Beginning a new feature or module
- Setting up examples or demonstrations
- Creating test projects for learning

### New Binary Project

**What**: Binary projects create executable applications that can be run directly.

**Why**: Binary projects are useful for:

- **Command-line applications** that users can run
- **Desktop applications** with user interfaces
- **Server applications** that provide services
- **Scripts and utilities** for automation
- **Learning projects** to practice Rust concepts

**How**: Here's how to create a new binary project:

```bash
# Create a new binary project
cargo new my_project
cd my_project

# This creates:
# my_project/
# ├── Cargo.toml
# └── src/
#     └── main.rs
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo new my_project` creates a new directory called `my_project`
- The project is automatically initialized as a binary (executable) project
- `Cargo.toml` contains project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration
- `src/main.rs` is the entry point where your program starts execution
- A Git repository is automatically initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- The project is immediately ready to build and run with `cargo run`

**Where**: Use binary projects for applications that users will run directly, such as command-line tools, web servers, or desktop applications.

### New Library Project

**What**: Library projects create reusable code that can be used by other Rust projects.

**Why**: Library projects are valuable because:

- **Code reusability** allows sharing functionality across projects
- **Modular design** breaks complex systems into manageable components
- **Publishing** enables sharing code with the Rust community
- **Testing** provides isolated environments for testing specific functionality
- **Documentation** creates clear APIs for other developers

**How**: Here's how to create a new library project:

```bash
# Create a new library project
cargo new my_library --lib
cd my_library

# This creates:
# my_library/
# ├── Cargo.toml
# └── src/
#     └── lib.rs
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo new my_library --lib` creates a library project with the `--lib` flag
- `src/lib.rs` is the library root where you define public functions and types
- Library projects don't have a `main.rs` file since they're not executables
- The library can be used by other projects as a dependency
- All public items in `lib.rs` become part of the library's API

**Where**: Use library projects when creating reusable code, publishing to crates.io, or building modular applications.

### Initialize in Existing Directory

**What**: You can initialize Cargo in an existing directory to add Rust project structure to existing code.

**Why**: Initialize in existing directories when:

- **Converting existing code** to use Cargo project structure
- **Adding Rust to mixed projects** that contain other languages
- **Gradual migration** from other build systems to Cargo
- **Working with legacy codebases** that need modern Rust tooling

**How**: Here's how to initialize Cargo in existing directories:

```bash
# Initialize cargo in current directory
cargo init

# Initialize as library
cargo init --lib
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo init` creates Cargo.toml and src/main.rs in the current directory
- `cargo init --lib` creates Cargo.toml and src/lib.rs for library projects
- Existing files are preserved and integrated into the Cargo project structure
- Git repository is initialized if one doesn't already exist
- This is useful for adding Rust to existing projects or converting from other build systems

**Where**: Use `cargo init` when you have existing code that you want to convert to a proper Cargo project structure.

## Cargo.toml Configuration

**What**: Cargo.toml is the configuration file that defines your project's metadata, dependencies, and build settings.

**Why**: Cargo.toml is crucial because:

- **Project metadata** provides information about your project to users and tools
- **Dependency management** specifies which external libraries your project needs
- **Build configuration** controls how your code is compiled and optimized
- **Publishing information** enables sharing your project on crates.io
- **Team collaboration** ensures consistent development environments

**When**: Configure Cargo.toml when:

- Creating new projects with specific requirements
- Adding dependencies to your project
- Preparing to publish packages
- Setting up build configurations
- Working with teams on shared projects

### Basic Package Configuration

**What**: The `[package]` section contains essential metadata about your Rust project.

**Why**: Package metadata is important because:

- **Identification** uniquely identifies your project in the Rust ecosystem
- **Versioning** enables proper dependency management and updates
- **Documentation** helps users understand what your project does
- **Licensing** clarifies how others can use your code
- **Publishing** provides information for crates.io and documentation sites

**How**: Here's how to configure basic package information:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
description = "A simple Rust project"
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://github.com/username/my_project"
homepage = "https://github.com/username/my_project"
documentation = "https://docs.rs/my_project"
readme = "README.md"
keywords = ["rust", "example"]
categories = ["development-tools"]
```

**Explanation**:

- `name` is the package name used in dependencies and on crates.io
- `version` follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- `edition` specifies which Rust edition to use (2015, 2018, 2021)
- `authors` lists the people who created and maintain the project
- `description` provides a brief summary of what the project does
- `license` specifies how others can use your code
- `repository` points to the source code repository
- `homepage` is the project's main website
- `documentation` links to generated documentation
- `readme` specifies the README file for the project
- `keywords` help users discover your project on crates.io
- `categories` classify your project for better organization

**Where**: Use this configuration in all Rust projects to provide proper metadata and enable publishing to crates.io.

### Dependencies

**What**: Dependencies are external libraries that your project needs to compile and run.

**Why**: Dependencies are essential because:

- **Code reuse** allows you to use well-tested libraries instead of writing everything from scratch
- **Ecosystem integration** connects your project to the broader Rust community
- **Feature completeness** provides functionality that would be time-consuming to implement
- **Maintenance** reduces the burden of maintaining all code yourself
- **Quality** leverages battle-tested libraries with known reliability

**How**: Here's how to configure different types of dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
# External crates
serde = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
clap = { version = "3.0", features = ["derive"] }

# Local dependencies
my_library = { path = "../my_library" }

# Git dependencies
my_crate = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo" }

# Development dependencies
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.3"
```

**Explanation**:

- `serde = "1.0"` specifies a simple version constraint for the serde crate
- `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }` uses a table format to specify version and enable all features
- `clap = { version = "3.0", features = ["derive"] }` enables only the "derive" feature for the clap crate
- `my_library = { path = "../my_library" }` uses a local dependency from a relative path
- `my_crate = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo" }` uses a dependency directly from a Git repository
- `[dev-dependencies]` section contains dependencies only needed for development and testing
- `criterion = "0.3"` is a benchmarking library only used during development

**Where**: Use dependencies when you need functionality that's already implemented in the Rust ecosystem, such as JSON parsing, HTTP clients, or database drivers.

### Features

**What**: Features are optional functionality that can be enabled or disabled when using your crate.

**Why**: Features are valuable because:

- **Conditional compilation** allows code to be included or excluded based on feature flags
- **Size optimization** enables smaller binaries by excluding unused functionality
- **Flexibility** lets users choose which parts of your library they need
- **Compatibility** supports different environments (std vs no_std)
- **Performance** allows users to enable only the features they need

**How**: Here's how to configure features:

```toml
[features]
default = ["std"]
std = []
no_std = []

[dependencies]
my_crate = { version = "1.0", optional = true }

[features]
my_feature = ["my_crate"]
```

**Explanation**:

- `default = ["std"]` specifies which features are enabled by default
- `std = []` defines a feature that enables standard library functionality
- `no_std = []` defines a feature for embedded or no_std environments
- `my_crate = { version = "1.0", optional = true }` makes a dependency optional
- `my_feature = ["my_crate"]` creates a feature that depends on the optional crate
- Features can depend on other features, creating a dependency graph

**Where**: Use features when your library supports multiple environments or when you want to provide optional functionality that users can enable as needed.

## Build Commands

**What**: Cargo provides various commands to build, test, and run your Rust projects with different configurations.

**Why**: Build commands are essential because:

- **Development workflow** provides fast feedback during coding
- **Optimization** enables different build modes for development vs production
- **Testing** ensures code quality and correctness
- **Cross-compilation** allows building for different target platforms
- **Debugging** provides tools to find and fix issues

**When**: Use build commands when:

- Developing and testing your code
- Preparing releases and deployments
- Debugging compilation issues
- Optimizing performance
- Building for different platforms

### Basic Build Commands

**What**: Basic build commands handle the core compilation process for your Rust projects.

**Why**: Basic builds are important because:

- **Fast compilation** during development with minimal optimization
- **Quick feedback** to catch errors early in the development cycle
- **Debug information** for effective debugging and development
- **Incremental builds** that only recompile changed code
- **Dependency resolution** that automatically handles external libraries

**How**: Here are the essential build commands:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Check code without building
cargo check

# Build specific target
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo build` compiles your project in debug mode with full debug information
- `cargo build --release` compiles with full optimization for production use
- `cargo check` performs type checking and linting without generating executable files
- `cargo build --target` compiles for a specific target architecture or operating system
- Debug builds are faster to compile but slower to run
- Release builds are slower to compile but much faster to run

**Where**: Use `cargo build` during development, `cargo build --release` for production deployments, and `cargo check` for quick syntax validation.

### Run Commands

**What**: Run commands compile and execute your Rust programs with various options and configurations.

**Why**: Run commands are valuable because:

- **Quick testing** allows you to test your code immediately after changes
- **Argument passing** enables testing with different inputs and configurations
- **Multiple binaries** support projects with multiple executable targets
- **Performance testing** allows testing with optimized release builds
- **Development workflow** provides immediate feedback during coding

**How**: Here are the essential run commands:

```bash
# Run the project
cargo run

# Run with arguments
cargo run -- arg1 arg2

# Run specific binary
cargo run --bin my_binary

# Run in release mode
cargo run --release
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo run` compiles and runs your main binary in debug mode
- `cargo run -- arg1 arg2` passes command-line arguments to your program
- `cargo run --bin my_binary` runs a specific binary from the src/bin/ directory
- `cargo run --release` compiles and runs with full optimization
- Arguments after `--` are passed directly to your program
- This is equivalent to `cargo build && ./target/debug/project_name`

**Where**: Use `cargo run` during development for quick testing, and `cargo run --release` for performance testing and production-like execution.

### Test Commands

**What**: Test commands run your project's test suite to verify code correctness and functionality.

**Why**: Testing is crucial because:

- **Code quality** ensures your code works as expected
- **Regression prevention** catches bugs when making changes
- **Documentation** tests serve as examples of how to use your code
- **Confidence** allows you to refactor and improve code safely
- **Continuous integration** enables automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

**How**: Here are the essential test commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests in release mode
cargo test --release

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Explanation**:

- `cargo test` runs all tests in your project (unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests)
- `cargo test test_name` runs only tests whose names contain "test_name"
- `cargo test --release` runs tests with full optimization enabled
- `cargo test -- --nocapture` shows output from println! statements during tests
- Tests are run in parallel by default for faster execution
- The `--` separator passes arguments to the test runner

**Where**: Use `cargo test` regularly during development to ensure code quality, and `cargo test --release` to verify performance characteristics.
