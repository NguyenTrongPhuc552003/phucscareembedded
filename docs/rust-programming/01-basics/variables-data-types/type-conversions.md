# Type Conversions

Master type conversions in Rust with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Are Type Conversions in Rust?

**What**: Type conversions in Rust are operations that transform values from one data type to another. Unlike many languages, Rust requires explicit conversions and provides both safe and unsafe conversion methods.

**Why**: Understanding type conversions is crucial because:

- **Type safety** prevents many common programming errors
- **Explicit conversions** make code intentions clear and predictable
- **Memory efficiency** allows you to choose appropriate data types
- **Error handling** enables safe conversion with proper error management
- **Performance** provides control over how data is processed and stored

**When**: Use type conversions when:

- You need to work with different numeric types
- Converting between strings and numbers
- Handling user input that needs type conversion
- Working with external APIs that use different types
- Implementing algorithms that require specific data types
- Building data processing pipelines

**How**: Type conversions work in Rust by:

- **Explicit casting** using the `as` keyword for basic conversions
- **Safe conversions** using `TryFrom`/`TryInto` traits for error handling
- **Guaranteed conversions** using `From`/`Into` traits for safe operations
- **String parsing** using `parse()` method for string-to-number conversions
- **Custom implementations** defining your own conversion logic

**Where**: Type conversions are used throughout Rust programs for data processing, API integration, user input handling, and building robust applications.

## Implicit vs Explicit Conversions

**What**: Rust's approach to type conversions emphasizes explicit, safe operations over implicit conversions that can hide bugs.

**Why**: Understanding this distinction is important because:

- **Explicit conversions** make code intentions clear and debuggable
- **Type safety** prevents unexpected behavior from hidden conversions
- **Error prevention** catches potential data loss at compile time
- **Code clarity** makes it obvious when conversions are happening
- **Performance** allows you to control exactly when conversions occur

**When**: Use explicit conversions when:

- You need to convert between different numeric types
- Working with user input that requires type conversion
- Integrating with external systems that use different types
- Building data processing pipelines
- Implementing algorithms that require specific data types

### No Implicit Conversions

**What**: Rust does not perform automatic type conversions, requiring you to be explicit about all conversions.

**How**: Here's how Rust's explicit conversion system works:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;              // i32
    let y = 3.14;           // f64

    // This won't compile - no implicit conversions!
    // let z = x + y;        // Error: cannot add i32 and f64

    // Must use explicit conversion
    let z = x as f64 + y;   // Convert i32 to f64
    println!("z: {}", z);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 5;` creates an `i32` integer variable
- `let y = 3.14;` creates an `f64` floating-point variable
- `let z = x + y;` would cause a compile error because you can't add different types
- `let z = x as f64 + y;` explicitly converts `x` to `f64` before adding
- The `as` keyword performs the type conversion
- This explicit approach prevents many common programming errors

**Why**: This demonstrates Rust's commitment to type safety by requiring explicit conversions, which prevents bugs that can occur from unexpected automatic conversions.

### Explicit Type Casting

**What**: Explicit type casting uses the `as` keyword to convert between compatible types.

**How**: Here's how to perform explicit type casting in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5i32;
    let y = 3.14f64;

    // Convert between numeric types
    let a = x as f64;        // i32 to f64
    let b = y as i32;        // f64 to i32 (truncates)
    let c = x as u8;         // i32 to u8

    println!("x: {}", x);
    println!("y: {}", y);
    println!("a: {}", a);
    println!("b: {}", b);
    println!("c: {}", c);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 5i32;` creates an `i32` integer with explicit type annotation
- `let y = 3.14f64;` creates an `f64` float with explicit type annotation
- `let a = x as f64;` converts the `i32` to `f64` (safe conversion)
- `let b = y as i32;` converts the `f64` to `i32` (truncates decimal part)
- `let c = x as u8;` converts the `i32` to `u8` (may lose data if value > 255)
- The `as` keyword performs the conversion
- Some conversions may lose data (truncation, overflow)

**Why**: Explicit casting gives you control over conversions but requires awareness of potential data loss.

## Numeric Type Conversions

### Integer to Integer

**What**: Integer to integer conversions are when you convert between integers of different sizes.

**How**: Here's how to work with integer to integer conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 300;

    // Safe conversions (no data loss)
    let y: i64 = x as i64;
    let z: f64 = x as f64;

    println!("x: {}", x);
    println!("y: {}", y);
    println!("z: {}", z);

    // Unsafe conversions (potential data loss)
    let w: u8 = x as u8;     // Truncates to 44
    println!("w: {}", w);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x: i32 = 300;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 300
- `let y: i64 = x as i64;` converts the `i32` to `i64`
- `let z: f64 = x as f64;` converts the `i32` to `f64`

**Why**: Integer to integer conversions are essential for working with integers of different sizes.

### Integer to Float

**What**: Integer to float conversions are when you convert between integers and floats.

**How**: Here's how to work with integer to float conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let y: u64 = 100;

    // Convert to float
    let a: f32 = x as f32;
    let b: f64 = y as f64;

    println!("x: {} -> f32: {}", x, a);
    println!("y: {} -> f64: {}", y, b);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x: i32 = 42;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 42
- `let y: f64 = y as f64;` converts the `i32` to `f64`

**Why**: Integer to float conversions are essential for working with integers and floats.

### Float to Integer

**What**: Float to integer conversions are when you convert between floats and integers.

**How**: Here's how to work with float to integer conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: f64 = 3.14;
    let y: f32 = 2.99;

    // Convert to integer (truncates)
    let a: i32 = x as i32;
    let b: u8 = y as u8;

    println!("x: {} -> i32: {}", x, a);
    println!("y: {} -> u8: {}", y, b);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x: f64 = 3.14;` creates a floating-point variable `x` with value 3.14
- `let y: f32 = 2.99;` creates another floating-point variable `y` with value 2.99

**Why**: Float to integer conversions are essential for working with floats and integers.

## Safe Type Conversions

### Using TryFrom/TryInto

**What**: Using TryFrom/TryInto is when you convert between types using the `TryFrom`/`TryInto` traits.

**How**: Here's how to work with TryFrom/TryInto in Rust:

```rust
use std::convert::TryInto;

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 300;

    // Safe conversion that can fail
    match x.try_into::<u8>() {
        Ok(value) => println!("Converted: {}", value),
        Err(_) => println!("Conversion failed: value too large"),
    }

    // Safe conversion for smaller values
    let y: i32 = 100;
    match y.try_into::<u8>() {
        Ok(value) => println!("Converted: {}", value),
        Err(_) => println!("Conversion failed"),
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x: i32 = 300;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 300
- `match x.try_into::<u8>() {` matches the value of `x`
- `Ok(value) => println!("Converted: {}", value),` prints the value of `value`
- `Err(_) => println!("Conversion failed: value too large"),` prints the message "conversion failed"

**Why**: Using TryFrom/TryInto is essential for safe conversions.

### Using From/Into

**What**: Using From/Into is when you convert between types using the `From`/`Into` traits.

**How**: Here's how to work with From/Into in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42;

    // Using From trait
    let y: f64 = f64::from(x);
    println!("y: {}", y);

    // Using Into trait
    let z: f64 = x.into();
    println!("z: {}", z);

    // Custom conversion
    let w: String = x.to_string();
    println!("w: {}", w);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x: i32 = 42;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 42
- `let y: f64 = f64::from(x);` converts the `i32` to `f64`
- `let z: f64 = x.into();` converts the `i32` to `f64`
- `let w: String = x.to_string();` converts the `i32` to `String`

**Why**: Using From/Into is essential for safe conversions.

## String Conversions

### Number to String

**What**: Number to string conversions are when you convert between numbers and strings.

**How**: Here's how to work with number to string conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let y = 3.14;

    // Convert to string
    let x_str = x.to_string();
    let y_str = y.to_string();

    println!("x as string: {}", x_str);
    println!("y as string: {}", y_str);

    // Using format! macro
    let formatted = format!("Number: {}", x);
    println!("formatted: {}", formatted);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 42;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 42
- `let y = 3.14;` creates another floating-point variable `y` with value 3.14
- `let x_str = x.to_string();` converts the `i32` to `String`
- `let y_str = y.to_string();` converts the `f64` to `String`
- `let formatted = format!("Number: {}", x);` formats the `i32` to a string

**Why**: Number to string conversions are essential for working with numbers and strings.

### String to Number

**What**: String to number conversions are when you convert between strings and numbers.

**How**: Here's how to work with string to number conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "42";
    let f = "3.14";

    // Parse string to number
    let x: i32 = s.parse().expect("Failed to parse");
    let y: f64 = f.parse().expect("Failed to parse");

    println!("x: {}", x);
    println!("y: {}", y);

    // Safe parsing with error handling
    match s.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(value) => println!("Parsed: {}", value),
        Err(e) => println!("Parse error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let s = "42";` creates a string variable `s` with value "42"
- `let f = "3.14";` creates another string variable `f` with value "3.14"
- `let x: i32 = s.parse().expect("Failed to parse");` converts the `String` to `i32`
- `let y: f64 = f.parse().expect("Failed to parse");` converts the `String` to `f64`

**Why**: String to number conversions are essential for working with strings and numbers.

### Character Conversions

**What**: Character to number conversions are when you convert between characters and numbers.

**How**: Here's how to work with character to number conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'A';
    let n = 65;

    // Character to number
    let char_to_num = c as u32;
    println!("'{}' as number: {}", c, char_to_num);

    // Number to character
    let num_to_char = char::from(n as u8);
    println!("{} as character: {}", n, num_to_char);

    // Unicode operations
    let unicode_char = '中';
    let unicode_value = unicode_char as u32;
    println!("Unicode: {} -> {}", unicode_char, unicode_value);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let c = 'A';` creates a character variable `c` with value 'A'
- `let n = 65;` creates an integer variable `n` with value 65
- `let char_to_num = c as u32;` converts the `char` to `u32`
- `let num_to_char = char::from(n as u8);` converts the `u32` to `char`

**Why**: Character to number conversions are essential for working with characters and numbers.

## Boolean Conversions

### Number to Boolean

**What**: Number to boolean conversions are when you convert between numbers and booleans.

**How**: Here's how to work with number to boolean conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 0;
    let y = 1;
    let z = 42;

    // Convert to boolean
    let a = x != 0;
    let b = y != 0;
    let c = z != 0;

    println!("{} -> {}", x, a);
    println!("{} -> {}", y, b);
    println!("{} -> {}", z, c);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 0;` creates an integer variable `x` with value 0
- `let y = 1;` creates another integer variable `y` with value 1
- `let z = 42;` creates another integer variable `z` with value 42

### Boolean to Number

**What**: Boolean to number conversions are when you convert between booleans and numbers.

**How**: Here's how to work with boolean to number conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;

    // Convert to number
    let x = a as i32;
    let y = b as i32;

    println!("{} -> {}", a, x);
    println!("{} -> {}", b, y);

    // Using if-else
    let z = if a { 1 } else { 0 };
    println!("{} -> {}", a, z);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let a = true;` creates a boolean variable `a` with value true
- `let b = false;` creates another boolean variable `b` with value false
- `let x = a as i32;` converts the `bool` to `i32`
- `let y = b as i32;` converts the `bool` to `i32`

**Why**: Boolean to number conversions are essential for working with booleans and numbers.

## Array and Tuple Conversions

### Array to Slice

**What**: Array to slice conversions are when you convert between arrays and slices.

**How**: Here's how to work with array to slice conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Convert to slice
    let slice: &[i32] = &arr;
    println!("Slice: {:?}", slice);

    // Partial slice
    let partial = &arr[1..4];
    println!("Partial: {:?}", partial);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` creates an array variable `arr` with value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- `let slice: &[i32] = &arr;` converts the `[i32; 5]` to `&[i32]`
- `let partial = &arr[1..4];` converts the `[i32; 5]` to `&[i32]`

**Why**: Array to slice conversions are essential for working with arrays and slices.

### Tuple to Array

**What**: Tuple to array conversions are when you convert between tuples and arrays.

**How**: Here's how to work with tuple to array conversions in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    // Convert tuple to array
    let arr = [tup.0, tup.1, tup.2, tup.3, tup.4];
    println!("Array: {:?}", arr);

    // Using destructuring
    let (a, b, c, d, e) = tup;
    let arr2 = [a, b, c, d, e];
    println!("Array2: {:?}", arr2);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);` creates a tuple variable `tup` with value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- `let arr = [tup.0, tup.1, tup.2, tup.3, tup.4];` converts the `(i32, i32, i32, i32, i32)` to `[i32; 5]`
- `let (a, b, c, d, e) = tup;` converts the `(i32, i32, i32, i32, i32)` to `(i32, i32, i32, i32, i32)`

**Why**: Tuple to array conversions are essential for working with tuples and arrays.

## Custom Type Conversions

### Implementing From/Into

**What**: Implementing From/Into is when you implement the `From`/`Into` traits for your own types.

**How**: Here's how to implement From/Into in Rust:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl From<(i32, i32)> for Point {
    fn from((x, y): (i32, i32)) -> Self {
        Point { x, y }
    }
}

impl From<Point> for (i32, i32) {
    fn from(point: Point) -> Self {
        (point.x, point.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Convert tuple to Point
    let point: Point = (10, 20).into();
    println!("Point: {:?}", point);

    // Convert Point to tuple
    let tuple: (i32, i32) = point.into();
    println!("Tuple: {:?}", tuple);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let point: Point = (10, 20).into();` converts the `(i32, i32)` to `Point`
- `let tuple: (i32, i32) = point.into();` converts the `Point` to `(i32, i32)`

**Why**: Implementing From/Into is essential for implementing your own conversions.

### Using TryFrom for Safe Conversions

**What**: Using TryFrom for safe conversions is when you convert between types using the `TryFrom` trait.

**How**: Here's how to use TryFrom for safe conversions in Rust:

```rust
use std::convert::TryFrom;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct PositiveNumber {
    value: u32,
}

impl TryFrom<i32> for PositiveNumber {
    type Error = String;

    fn try_from(value: i32) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        if value > 0 {
            Ok(PositiveNumber { value: value as u32 })
        } else {
            Err("Number must be positive".to_string())
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Safe conversion
    match PositiveNumber::try_from(42) {
        Ok(pos_num) => println!("Positive number: {:?}", pos_num),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }

    // Unsafe conversion
    match PositiveNumber::try_from(-5) {
        Ok(pos_num) => println!("Positive number: {:?}", pos_num),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `match PositiveNumber::try_from(42) {` matches the value of `42`
- `Ok(pos_num) => println!("Positive number: {:?}", pos_num),` prints the value of `pos_num`
- `Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),` prints the value of `e`

**Why**: Using TryFrom for safe conversions is essential for safe conversions.

## Common Conversion Patterns

### Number Formatting

**What**: Number formatting is when you format a number with separators and different bases.

**How**: Here's how to work with number formatting in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 1234567;

    // Format with separators
    println!("Formatted: {:,}", number);

    // Format with different bases
    println!("Binary: {:b}", number);
    println!("Hex: {:x}", number);
    println!("Octal: {:o}", number);

    // Format with padding
    println!("Padded: {:010}", number);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let number = 1234567;` creates an integer variable `number` with value 1234567
- `println!("Formatted: {:,}", number);` formats the `i32` to a string with separators
- `println!("Binary: {:b}", number);` formats the `i32` to a string with binary base
- `println!("Hex: {:x}", number);` formats the `i32` to a string with hex base
- `println!("Octal: {:o}", number);` formats the `i32` to a string with octal base
- `println!("Padded: {:010}", number);` formats the `i32` to a string with padding

**Why**: Number formatting is essential for representing numbers with separators and different bases.

### Type Checking

**What**: Type checking is when you check if a value can be converted to another type.

**How**: Here's how to work with type checking in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let value = 42;

    // Check if value can be converted
    if value >= 0 && value <= 255 {
        let byte: u8 = value as u8;
        println!("Can convert to u8: {}", byte);
    } else {
        println!("Cannot convert to u8 safely");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let value = 42;` creates an integer variable `value` with value 42
- `if value >= 0 && value <= 255 {` checks if the value is between 0 and 255
- `let byte: u8 = value as u8;` converts the `i32` to `u8`
- `println!("Can convert to u8: {}", byte);` prints the value of `byte`
- `println!("Cannot convert to u8 safely");` prints the message "cannot convert to u8 safely"

**Why**: Type checking is essential for checking if a value can be converted to another type.
