- **Detailed explanations** helping you understand every line of code
- **Skill building** preparing you for advanced Rust programming

**Where**: Use these exercises in your learning journey to solidify your understanding of Rust fundamentals and prepare for more advanced topics.

## Exercise 1: Variable Declaration and Mutability

**What**: This exercise practices creating and using both immutable and mutable variables in Rust.

**Why**: Understanding variable declaration and mutability is crucial because:

- **Foundation building** establishes the basic concepts of Rust programming
- **Type understanding** helps you choose the right variable types
- **Mutability control** teaches you when and how to use mutable variables
- **Best practices** shows you Rust's approach to variable management
- **Real-world application** demonstrates practical variable usage

**When**: Use this exercise when:

- You're learning the basics of Rust variables
- You want to understand the difference between immutable and mutable variables
- You need practice with variable declaration and modification
- You're building confidence with Rust syntax
- You're preparing for more complex programming tasks

### Basic Variable Practice

**What**: A comprehensive exercise that demonstrates both immutable and mutable variable usage.

**How**: Here's how to practice variable declaration and mutability:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Declare immutable variables
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 25;
    let height = 5.6;
    let is_student = true;

    // Declare mutable variables
    let mut score = 0;
    let mut attempts = 0;
    let mut is_playing = true;

    // Print all variables
    println!("Name: {}", name);
    println!("Age: {}", age);
    println!("Height: {}", height);
    println!("Is student: {}", is_student);
    println!("Score: {}", score);
    println!("Attempts: {}", attempts);
    println!("Is playing: {}", is_playing);

    // Modify mutable variables
    score += 10;
    attempts += 1;
    is_playing = false;

    println!("After modification:");
    println!("Score: {}", score);
    println!("Attempts: {}", attempts);
    println!("Is playing: {}", is_playing);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let name = "Alice";` creates an immutable string variable
- `let age = 25;` creates an immutable integer variable
- `let height = 5.6;` creates an immutable floating-point variable
- `let is_student = true;` creates an immutable boolean variable
- `let mut score = 0;` creates a mutable integer variable using the `mut` keyword
- `let mut attempts = 0;` creates another mutable integer variable
- `let mut is_playing = true;` creates a mutable boolean variable
- The first set of `println!` statements displays the initial values
- `score += 10;` modifies the mutable score variable
- `attempts += 1;` increments the attempts counter
- `is_playing = false;` changes the boolean state
- The second set of `println!` statements shows the modified values

**Why**: This exercise demonstrates the fundamental difference between immutable and mutable variables in Rust, showing how to declare, use, and modify variables appropriately.

### Shadowing Practice

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("x = {}", x);

    let x = x + 1;
    println!("x = {}", x);

    let x = x * 2;
    println!("x = {}", x);

    {
        let x = x - 3;
        println!("x in inner scope = {}", x);
    }

    println!("x in outer scope = {}", x);
}
```

## Exercise 2: Scalar Types Practice

### Integer Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 10;
    let b: i32 = 3;
    let c: u8 = 255;
    let d: i16 = -32768;

    println!("a + b = {}", a + b);
    println!("a - b = {}", a - b);
    println!("a * b = {}", a * b);
    println!("a / b = {}", a / b);
    println!("a % b = {}", a % b);

    println!("c = {}", c);
    println!("d = {}", d);

    // Check integer overflow
    let result = a.checked_add(b);
    match result {
        Some(value) => println!("a + b = {}", value),
        None => println!("Overflow occurred!"),
    }
}
```

### Floating-Point Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: f64 = 3.14159;
    let y: f32 = 2.71828;
    let z: f64 = 1.41421;

    println!("x = {}", x);
    println!("y = {}", y);
    println!("z = {}", z);

    // Basic operations
    println!("x + y = {}", x + y as f64);
    println!("x - y = {}", x - y as f64);
    println!("x * y = {}", x * y as f64);
    println!("x / y = {}", x / y as f64);

    // Special values
    let inf = f64::INFINITY;
    let neg_inf = f64::NEG_INFINITY;
    let nan = f64::NAN;

    println!("Infinity: {}", inf);
    println!("Negative infinity: {}", neg_inf);
    println!("NaN: {}", nan);

    // Check for special values
    println!("Is infinity: {}", x.is_infinite());
    println!("Is NaN: {}", x.is_nan());
}
```

### Character Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let chars = ['A', 'a', '1', 'ä¸­', 'ðŸš€', 'âˆ‘'];

    for c in chars.iter() {
        println!("Character: {}", c);
        println!("  Is alphabetic: {}", c.is_alphabetic());
        println!("  Is numeric: {}", c.is_numeric());
        println!("  Is uppercase: {}", c.is_uppercase());
        println!("  Is lowercase: {}", c.is_lowercase());
        println!("  Unicode value: {}", *c as u32);
        println!();
    }
}
```

## Exercise 3: Compound Types Practice

### Tuple Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create tuples
    let person = ("Alice", 25, 5.6);
    let coordinates = (10, 20);
    let rgb_color = (255, 128, 64);

    // Access tuple elements
    println!("Person: {:?}", person);
    println!("Name: {}", person.0);
    println!("Age: {}", person.1);
    println!("Height: {}", person.2);

    // Destructure tuples
    let (name, age, height) = person;
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}, Height: {}", name, age, height);

    // Destructure with some ignored
    let (x, y) = coordinates;
    println!("Coordinates: ({}, {})", x, y);

    // Nested tuples
    let nested = ((1, 2), (3, 4));
    let ((a, b), (c, d)) = nested;
    println!("Nested: (({}, {}), ({}, {}))", a, b, c, d);
}
```

### Array Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create arrays
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let words = ["hello", "world", "rust"];
    let matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ];

    // Access array elements
    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("First number: {}", numbers[0]);
    println!("Last number: {}", numbers[4]);

    // Iterate through array
    for (index, number) in numbers.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("numbers[{}] = {}", index, number);
    }

    // Array operations
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    let count = numbers.len();
    let average = sum as f64 / count as f64;

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    println!("Count: {}", count);
    println!("Average: {:.2}", average);

    // 2D array
    println!("Matrix:");
    for row in matrix.iter() {
        for element in row.iter() {
            print!("{} ", element);
        }
        println!();
    }
}
```

## Exercise 4: Type Conversions Practice

### Numeric Conversions

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let y: f64 = 3.14;
    let z: u8 = 255;

    // Convert between types
    let a = x as f64;
    let b = y as i32;
    let c = z as i32;

    println!("x: {} -> f64: {}", x, a);
    println!("y: {} -> i32: {}", y, b);
    println!("z: {} -> i32: {}", z, c);

    // Safe conversions
    match x.try_into::<u8>() {
        Ok(value) => println!("x -> u8: {}", value),
        Err(_) => println!("x -> u8: conversion failed"),
    }

    match 300.try_into::<u8>() {
        Ok(value) => println!("300 -> u8: {}", value),
        Err(_) => println!("300 -> u8: conversion failed"),
    }
}
```

### String Conversions

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [42, 3.14, 100];
    let strings = ["42", "3.14", "hello"];

    // Convert numbers to strings
    for num in numbers.iter() {
        let str = num.to_string();
        println!("{} -> '{}'", num, str);
    }

    // Parse strings to numbers
    for s in strings.iter() {
        if let Ok(num) = s.parse::<i32>() {
            println!("'{}' -> i32: {}", s, num);
        } else if let Ok(num) = s.parse::<f64>() {
            println!("'{}' -> f64: {}", s, num);
        } else {
            println!("'{}' -> string: {}", s, s);
        }
    }
}
```

## Exercise 5: Constants and Variables

fn main() {
    println!("Max users: {}", MAX_USERS);
    println!("Pi: {}", PI);
    println!("Company: {}", COMPANY_NAME);
    println!("Debug mode: {}", IS_DEBUG);

        println!("y in inner scope: {}", y);

        {
            let z = 15;
            println!("x in innermost scope: {}", x);
            println!("y in innermost scope: {}", y);
            println!("z in innermost scope: {}", z);
        }

        // z is out of scope here
        // println!("z: {}", z); // This would cause an error
    }

    // y is out of scope here
    // println!("y: {}", y); // This would cause an error
    println!("x in outer scope: {}", x);
}
```

### Shadowing Practice

    }

    println!("x in outer scope = {}", x);
}
```

    let y: f64 = 3.14;
    let z: bool = true;
    let c: char = 'A';
    let s: &str = "Hello";

    // Array with explicit type
    let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Tuple with explicit type
    let point: (i32, i32) = (10, 20);

    println!("x: {}", x);
    println!("y: {}", y);
    println!("z: {}", z);
    println!("c: {}", c);
    println!("s: {}", s);
    println!("numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("point: {:?}", point);
}
```

## Exercise 8: Number Formatting

### Formatting Practice

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 1234567;
    let float = 3.14159;

    // Basic formatting
    println!("Number: {}", number);
    println!("Float: {}", float);

    // Format with separators
    println!("Number with separators: {:,}", number);

    // Format with different bases
    println!("Binary: {:b}", number);
    println!("Hex: {:x}", number);
    println!("Octal: {:o}", number);

    // Format with padding
    println!("Padded: {:010}", number);

    // Float formatting
    println!("Float 2 decimal places: {:.2}", float);
    println!("Float 4 decimal places: {:.4}", float);
    println!("Float scientific: {:e}", float);
}
```

## Exercise 9: Character Analysis

### Character Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let chars = ['A', 'a', '1', 'ä¸­', 'ðŸš€', 'âˆ‘', ' ', '\n', '\t'];

    for c in chars.iter() {
        println!("Character: '{}'", c);
        println!("  Is alphabetic: {}", c.is_alphabetic());
        println!("  Is numeric: {}", c.is_numeric());
        println!("  Is uppercase: {}", c.is_uppercase());
        println!("  Is lowercase: {}", c.is_lowercase());
        println!("  Is whitespace: {}", c.is_whitespace());
        println!("  Unicode value: {}", *c as u32);
        println!();
    }
}
```

## Exercise 10: Array Statistics

### Array Analysis

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Basic statistics
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    let count = numbers.len();
    let average = sum as f64 / count as f64;

    // Min and max
    let min = numbers.iter().min().unwrap();
    let max = numbers.iter().max().unwrap();

    // Even and odd counts
    let even_count = numbers.iter().filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0).count();
    let odd_count = numbers.iter().filter(|&&x| x % 2 != 0).count();

    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    println!("Count: {}", count);
    println!("Average: {:.2}", average);
    println!("Min: {}", min);
