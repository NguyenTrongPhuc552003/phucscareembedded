# Practical Exercises - Ownership Fundamentals

Master Rust's ownership system with comprehensive hands-on exercises using the 4W+H framework.

## What Are Practical Exercises for Ownership Fundamentals?

**What**: Practical exercises are hands-on coding challenges that reinforce the ownership, borrowing, and memory management concepts you've learned in the Ownership Fundamentals chapter.

**Why**: Practical exercises are essential because:

- **Skill reinforcement** helps you internalize Rust's ownership concepts through practice
- **Real-world application** connects theoretical knowledge to practical programming
- **Problem-solving development** builds your ability to think like a Rust programmer
- **Confidence building** gives you hands-on experience with ownership, borrowing, and memory management
- **Learning progression** prepares you for more advanced Rust concepts
- **Ownership mastery** helps you understand Rust's unique memory safety guarantees

**When**: Complete these exercises when:

- You've finished the Ownership Fundamentals lessons
- You want to practice what you've learned about ownership, borrowing, and memory management
- You're preparing for the next phase of Rust learning
- You need hands-on experience with Rust's ownership system
- You want to build confidence in your Rust programming skills

**How**: These exercises work by:

- **Progressive difficulty** starting with simple ownership concepts and building complexity
- **Real-world scenarios** using practical examples you might encounter
- **Comprehensive coverage** testing all the concepts from the chapter
- **Detailed explanations** helping you understand every line of code
- **Skill building** preparing you for advanced Rust programming

**Where**: Use these exercises in your learning journey to solidify your understanding of Rust's ownership system and prepare for more advanced topics.

## Exercise 1: Basic Ownership

**What**: This exercise practices the fundamental concept of ownership transfer in Rust.

**Why**: Understanding ownership transfer is crucial because:

- **Memory safety** prevents multiple variables from trying to manage the same memory
- **Predictable behavior** ensures only one owner is responsible at any given time
- **Resource management** ensures proper cleanup when ownership changes
- **Performance** avoids unnecessary data copying for heap-allocated types
- **Concurrency safety** prevents data races by ensuring exclusive ownership

**When**: Use ownership transfer when:

- You need to pass heap-allocated data between variables
- You want to transfer responsibility for memory management
- You're working with types that do not implement the `Copy` trait
- You need to move data to avoid copying

**How**: Ownership transfer works by moving the ownership from one variable to another.

**Where**: Ownership transfer is used throughout Rust programs for memory management and data passing.

### Ownership Transfer

**What**: A simple example showing how ownership is transferred between variables.

**How**: Here's how ownership transfer works:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved to s2

    // This won't compile
    // println!("s1: {}", s1);
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let s1 = String::from("hello");` creates a `String` and `s1` becomes its owner
- `let s2 = s1;` moves ownership of the `String` data from `s1` to `s2`
- After the move, `s1` is no longer considered valid or usable
- Attempting to use `s1` after the move (e.g., `println!("s1: {}", s1);`) would result in a compile-time error
- `s2` is now the sole owner of the `String` data
- When `s2` goes out of scope, the `String` data will be dropped

**Why**: This demonstrates the "move" semantic in Rust, where ownership is transferred, and the previous owner becomes invalid, preventing double-free errors and ensuring memory safety.

### Ownership with Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);
    // s is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;
    makes_copy(x);
    println!("x: {}", x);  // x is still valid
}

fn takes_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn makes_copy(x: i32) {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

### Return Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = takes_and_gives_back(s1);
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(s: String) -> String {
    s
}
```

## Exercise 2: References and Borrowing

### Basic Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Mutable Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Multiple Immutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    println!("r1: {}, r2: {}", r1, r2);
}
```

## Exercise 3: String Slices

### Basic String Slices

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];

    println!("{}", hello);
    println!("{}", world);
}
```

### First Word Function

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("First word: {}", word);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

### Improved First Word

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("First word: {}", word);

    let s2 = "hello world";
    let word2 = first_word_str(s2);
    println!("First word: {}", word2);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

fn first_word_str(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

## Exercise 4: Array Slices

### Basic Array Slices

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let slice = &a[1..4];
    println!("Array: {:?}", a);
    println!("Slice: {:?}", slice);
}
```

### Slice Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let sum = sum_slice(&numbers[2..8]);
    println!("Sum of slice: {}", sum);
}

fn sum_slice(slice: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    slice.iter().sum()
}
```

## Exercise 5: Ownership with Structs

### Basic Struct Ownership

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 25,
    };

    print_person(&person);
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", person.name, person.age);
}

fn print_person(p: &Person) {
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", p.name, p.age);
}
```

### Struct with Methods

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    let rect2 = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 40 };

    println!("Area of rect1: {}", rect1.area());
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
}
```

## Exercise 6: Ownership with Enums

### Enum with Data

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let messages = vec![
        Message::Quit,
        Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 },
        Message::Write(String::from("hello")),
        Message::ChangeColor(255, 0, 0),
    ];

    for msg in &messages {
        process_message(msg);
    }
}

fn process_message(msg: &Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write: {}", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
    }
}
```

## Exercise 7: Common Ownership Patterns

### Avoiding Moves

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Multiple Returns

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let (s2, len) = calculate_length_and_return(s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length_and_return(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len();
    (s, length)
}
```

### Cloning When Necessary

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();
    println!("s1: {}, s2: {}", s1, s2);
}
```

## Exercise 8: Error Handling with Ownership

### Safe Division

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 2);
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }

    let error_result = divide(10, 0);
    match error_result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}

fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if y != 0 {
        Ok(x / y)
    } else {
        Err("Division by zero".to_string())
    }
}
```

### Safe Array Access

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let index = 3;

    match safe_get(&numbers, index) {
        Some(value) => println!("numbers[{}] = {}", index, value),
        None => println!("Index {} is out of bounds!", index),
    }
}

fn safe_get<T>(arr: &[T], index: usize) -> Option<&T> {
    arr.get(index)
}
```

## Exercise 9: Advanced Ownership Patterns

### Ownership in Loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let words = vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")];

    for word in &words {
        println!("{}", word);
    }

    println!("Words: {:?}", words);
}
```

### Ownership with Closures

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
    println!("Original: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Doubled: {:?}", doubled);
}
```

### Ownership with Iterators

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    let max = numbers.iter().max().unwrap();
    let min = numbers.iter().min().unwrap();

    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    println!("Max: {}", max);
    println!("Min: {}", min);
}
```

## Exercise 10: Memory Management

### Stack vs Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack data
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;  // Copy
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);

    // Heap data
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // Move
    // println!("{}", s1);  // Error
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Memory Layout

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

struct Person {
    name: String,  // Heap
    age: u32,      // Stack
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };  // Stack
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),  // Heap
        age: 25,                      // Stack
    };

    println!("Point: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);
    println!("Person: {}, {}", person.name, person.age);
}
```

## Exercise 11: Ownership with Collections

### Vector Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    double_elements(&mut numbers);
    println!("Doubled: {:?}", numbers);
}

fn double_elements(numbers: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    for number in numbers.iter_mut() {
        *number *= 2;
    }
}
```

### HashMap Ownership

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 95);
    scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 87);

    for (name, score) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", name, score);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 12: Ownership Best Practices

### Function Design

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("First word: {}", word);
    println!("String: {}", s);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

### Avoiding Unnecessary Allocations

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length: {}", len);
    println!("String: {}", s);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
