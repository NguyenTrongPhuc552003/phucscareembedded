# References and Borrowing

Master Rust's borrowing system with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Are References and Borrowing in Rust?

**What**: References and borrowing in Rust allow you to access data without taking ownership of it. References are like pointers but with compile-time safety guarantees that prevent common memory errors.

**Why**: Understanding references and borrowing is crucial because:

- **Memory safety** prevents use-after-free, double-free, and other memory bugs
- **Performance** enables efficient data access without copying
- **Flexibility** allows multiple parts of your code to access the same data safely
- **Ownership preservation** lets you keep ownership while sharing access
- **Zero-cost abstractions** provide safety without runtime overhead
- **Concurrency safety** prevents data races in multi-threaded programs

**When**: Use references and borrowing when:

- You need to access data without taking ownership
- Passing large data structures to functions efficiently
- Working with data that multiple parts of your code need to access
- Implementing algorithms that need to examine data without modifying it
- Building data structures that share references to common data
- Writing functions that need to read or modify data temporarily

**How**: References and borrowing work in Rust by:

- **Creating references** using the `&` operator for immutable references and `&mut` for mutable references
- **Borrowing rules** enforced by the compiler to prevent data races and memory issues
- **Lifetime tracking** ensuring references are always valid
- **Automatic dereferencing** making references easy to use
- **Zero-cost abstractions** providing safety without performance penalties

**Where**: References and borrowing are used throughout Rust programs for efficient data access, function parameters, and building complex data structures.

## What Are References?

**What**: References are a way to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.

**Why**: References are important because:

- **Ownership preservation** allows you to keep ownership while sharing access
- **Memory efficiency** avoids copying large data structures
- **Safety** prevents common pointer-related bugs
- **Flexibility** enables multiple parts of code to access the same data
- **Performance** provides fast access without ownership transfer

**When**: Use references when you need to access data without taking ownership.

**How**: References work by pointing to data owned by another variable.

**Where**: References are used throughout Rust programs for efficient data access.

### Basic References

**What**: A simple example showing how to create and use references to avoid taking ownership.

**How**: Here's how basic references work:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // &s1 creates a reference
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}", s1, len);  // s1 is still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {  // s is a reference to String
    s.len()
}  // s goes out of scope, but since it's a reference, nothing is dropped
```

**Explanation**:

- `let s1 = String::from("hello");` creates a `String` owned by `s1`
- `&s1` creates a reference to the string without taking ownership
- `calculate_length(&s1)` passes a reference to the function
- The function parameter `s: &String` receives a reference to a `String`
- `s.len()` accesses the length through the reference
- `s1` remains valid after the function call because we only borrowed it
- When the function ends, the reference `s` goes out of scope, but the original string is not dropped

**Why**: This demonstrates how references allow you to access data without taking ownership, enabling you to keep the original data while sharing access with functions.

### Immutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s;  // r1 is an immutable reference
    let r2 = &s;  // r2 is another immutable reference

    println!("r1: {}", r1);
    println!("r2: {}", r2);
    println!("s: {}", s);  // s is still valid
}
```

### Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);  // &mut s creates a mutable reference
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

## Borrowing Rules

### Rule 1: You can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    // Multiple immutable references are OK
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    println!("r1: {}, r2: {}", r1, r2);

    // But you can't have mutable and immutable references at the same time
    // let r3 = &mut s;  // Error: cannot borrow as mutable
    // println!("r1: {}", r1);  // Error: r1 is still in use
}
```

### Rule 2: References must always be valid

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r = &s;  // r is valid as long as s is valid
    println!("{}", r);
}  // s goes out of scope, r is no longer valid
```

### Mutable Reference Restrictions

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    // Only one mutable reference at a time
    let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s;  // Error: cannot borrow as mutable more than once

    println!("{}", r1);
}
```

## Common Borrowing Patterns

### Avoiding Moves

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // Borrow s1 instead of moving it
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}", s1, len);  // s1 is still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Mutable Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    append_world(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn append_world(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Multiple Immutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    let r3 = &s;

    println!("r1: {}", r1);
    println!("r2: {}", r2);
    println!("r3: {}", r3);
    println!("s: {}", s);
}
```

## String Slices

### Basic String Slices

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let hello = &s[0..5];  // "hello"
    let world = &s[6..11]; // "world"

    println!("{}", hello);
    println!("{}", world);
}
```

### Slice Syntax

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    // Different ways to create slices
    let slice1 = &s[0..5];
    let slice2 = &s[..5];    // Same as above
    let slice3 = &s[6..];    // From index 6 to end
    let slice4 = &s[..];     // Entire string

    println!("slice1: {}", slice1);
    println!("slice2: {}", slice2);
    println!("slice3: {}", slice3);
    println!("slice4: {}", slice4);
}
```

### String Slices as Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("First word: {}", word);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

## Array Slices

### Basic Array Slices

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let slice = &a[1..4];  // [2, 3, 4]

    println!("Array: {:?}", a);
    println!("Slice: {:?}", slice);
}
```

### Slice Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let sum = sum_slice(&numbers[2..8]);
    println!("Sum of slice: {}", sum);
}

fn sum_slice(slice: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for &item in slice.iter() {
        sum += item;
    }
    sum
}
```

## Borrowing in Functions

### Function Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length: {}", len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Mutable Function Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    modify_string(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn modify_string(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Returning References

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let word = first_word(&s);
    println!("First word: {}", word);
}

fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

## Common Borrowing Errors

### Dangling References

```rust
// This won't compile - creates a dangling reference
// fn dangle() -> &String {
//     let s = String::from("hello");
//     &s  // s goes out of scope, reference becomes invalid
// }

fn main() {
    // This is safe - returns owned value
    let s = no_dangle();
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s  // Return owned value
}
```

### Borrowing After Move

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r = &s;
    let s2 = s;  // s is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", r);  // Error: r is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Mutable and Immutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s;  // Immutable reference
    // let r2 = &mut s;  // Error: cannot borrow as mutable
    // let r3 = &mut s;  // Error: cannot borrow as mutable
    println!("{}", r1);
}
```

## Advanced Borrowing

### Borrowing in Loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let words = vec![String::from("hello"), String::from("world")];

    for word in &words {  // Borrow each word
        println!("{}", word);
    }

    println!("Words: {:?}", words);  // words is still valid
}
```

### Borrowing in Structs

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 25,
    };

    print_person(&person);  // Borrow person
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", person.name, person.age);  // person is still valid
}

fn print_person(p: &Person) {
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", p.name, p.age);
}
```

### Borrowing in Enums

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
    process_message(&msg);  // Borrow msg
}

fn process_message(msg: &Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write: {}", text),
    }
}
```

## Practice Exercises

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

}
```
