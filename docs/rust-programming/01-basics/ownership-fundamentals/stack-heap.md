# Stack vs Heap

Master Rust's memory management with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Are Stack and Heap in Rust?

**What**: Stack and heap are two different regions of memory that Rust uses to store data. The stack stores fixed-size data with automatic management, while the heap stores dynamic data that can grow and shrink.

**Why**: Understanding stack and heap is crucial because:

- **Memory efficiency** helps you choose the right data storage strategy
- **Performance optimization** enables you to write faster, more efficient code
- **Ownership understanding** explains why some operations are fast and others are slow
- **Memory safety** shows how Rust prevents common memory-related bugs
- **Resource management** helps you understand when and why memory is allocated
- **Debugging skills** enables you to identify performance bottlenecks and memory issues

**When**: Use stack vs heap knowledge when:

- Choosing between different data types for performance
- Understanding why some operations are fast and others are slow
- Debugging memory-related performance issues
- Designing data structures for optimal memory usage
- Working with large datasets that need efficient memory management
- Building systems that require predictable memory behavior

**How**: Stack and heap work in Rust by:

- **Stack allocation** storing fixed-size data with automatic cleanup
- **Heap allocation** storing dynamic data with explicit management
- **Ownership system** automatically managing memory lifecycle
- **Copy vs Move semantics** determining how data is transferred
- **Reference system** allowing safe access without ownership transfer
- **Automatic cleanup** preventing memory leaks and use-after-free errors

**Where**: Stack and heap concepts are used throughout Rust programs for data storage, function calls, and memory management.

## Stack Memory

### What Is the Stack?

**What**: The stack is a region of memory that stores data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. It's fast, automatic, and perfect for fixed-size data.

**Why**: Understanding the stack is important because:

- **Performance** - Stack operations are extremely fast
- **Automatic management** - No manual memory management needed
- **Predictable behavior** - Stack operations are deterministic
- **Memory safety** - Stack data is automatically cleaned up
- **Function calls** - Stack manages function parameters and local variables
- **Efficiency** - Stack allocation and deallocation are very cheap

**When**: Use the stack when:

- Working with fixed-size data types
- Storing local variables in functions
- Passing parameters to functions
- Working with primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
- Creating temporary data that doesn't need to persist

**How**: The stack works by:

- **LIFO order** - Last item added is first item removed
- **Automatic allocation** - Memory is allocated when variables are created
- **Automatic cleanup** - Memory is freed when variables go out of scope
- **Fast access** - Stack operations are very fast
- **Fixed size** - Stack data must have a known size at compile time

**Where**: Stack memory is used for local variables, function parameters, and temporary data in Rust programs.

### Stack Characteristics

**What**: A demonstration of how different data types are stored on the stack.

**How**: Here's how stack storage works:

```rust
fn main() {
    // These values are stored on the stack
    let x = 5;           // i32 on stack
    let y = 3.14;       // f64 on stack
    let flag = true;    // bool on stack
    let ch = 'A';       // char on stack

    println!("x: {}, y: {}, flag: {}, ch: {}", x, y, flag, ch);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let x = 5;` creates an `i32` integer stored directly on the stack
- `let y = 3.14;` creates an `f64` floating-point number stored on the stack
- `let flag = true;` creates a `bool` boolean value stored on the stack
- `let ch = 'A';` creates a `char` character stored on the stack
- All these values have fixed sizes known at compile time
- Stack memory is automatically managed - no manual allocation or deallocation needed
- When the function ends, all stack variables are automatically cleaned up

**Why**: This demonstrates that primitive types with known sizes are stored efficiently on the stack, providing fast access and automatic memory management.

### Stack Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 5;      // a is pushed onto stack
    let b = 10;     // b is pushed onto stack
    let c = a + b;  // c is calculated and pushed onto stack

    println!("a: {}, b: {}, c: {}", a, b, c);
}  // a, b, c are popped from stack
```

### Function Call Stack

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let result = add(x, y);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    let sum = a + b;  // sum is on the stack
    sum
}  // sum is popped from stack
```

## Heap Memory

### What is the Heap?

The heap is a region of memory for dynamic allocation. It's slower than the stack but can grow and shrink.

### Heap Allocation

```rust
fn main() {
    // String allocates memory on the heap
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s owns the heap memory
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope, heap memory is freed
```

### Heap vs Stack with Strings

```rust
fn main() {
    // String literal (stack)
    let s1 = "hello";  // &str, stored on stack

    // String (heap)
    let s2 = String::from("hello");  // String, stored on heap

    println!("s1: {}", s1);
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}
```

## Ownership and Memory

### Stack-Only Data

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;      // i32 on stack
    let y = x;      // y gets a copy of x
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // Both are valid
}
```

### Heap Data

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");  // s1 owns heap memory
    let s2 = s1;                     // s1 is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1);           // Error: s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);              // s2 owns the heap memory
}
```

### Memory Layout Example

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack data
    let x = 5;           // Stack: x = 5
    let y = 3.14;        // Stack: y = 3.14

    // Heap data
    let s = String::from("hello");  // Stack: s = (ptr, len, capacity)
                                   // Heap: "hello" stored at ptr
    println!("x: {}, y: {}, s: {}", x, y, s);
}
```

## Copy vs Move

### Copy Trait

```rust
fn main() {
    // Types that implement Copy are copied, not moved
    let x = 5;      // i32 implements Copy
    let y = x;      // y gets a copy of x
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // Both are valid

    let flag = true;    // bool implements Copy
    let flag2 = flag;   // flag2 gets a copy of flag
    println!("flag: {}, flag2: {}", flag, flag2);
}
```

### Move Semantics

```rust
fn main() {
    // String does not implement Copy
    let s1 = String::from("hello");  // s1 owns heap memory
    let s2 = s1;                     // s1 is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1);           // Error: s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);              // s2 now owns the heap memory
}
```

## Memory Management

### Automatic Memory Management

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // Memory allocated on heap
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope, memory is automatically freed
```

### No Garbage Collection Needed

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = String::from("world");
    let s3 = String::from("rust");

    println!("{}", s1);
    println!("{}", s2);
    println!("{}", s3);
}  // All strings are automatically freed when they go out of scope
```

### Memory Safety

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    // No need to manually free memory
    // No risk of memory leaks
    // No risk of use-after-free
    // No risk of double-free
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Avoiding Unnecessary Allocations

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Don't do this - creates unnecessary allocation
    // let s2 = s.clone();
    // println!("{}", s);
    // println!("{}", s2);

    // Do this instead - use references
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Heap vs Stack Performance

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack operations are fast
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let sum = x + y;

    // Heap operations are slower but necessary for dynamic data
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s.clone();  // Expensive operation
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

## Memory Layout Examples

### Struct on Stack

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };  // Point stored on stack
    println!("Point: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);
}
```

### Struct with Heap Data

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,  // String stored on heap
    age: u32,     // u32 stored on stack
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),  // name on heap
        age: 25,                      // age on stack
    };
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", person.name, person.age);
}
```

### Vector Memory Layout

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // Vector header on stack, data on heap
    println!("Vector: {:?}", v);
}
```

## Common Memory Issues (Prevented by Rust)

### Use After Free (Prevented)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r = &s;  // r borrows s
    // s goes out of scope here, but r is still valid
    // Rust prevents this at compile time
    println!("{}", r);
}
```

### Double Free (Prevented)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    // s goes out of scope and is automatically freed
    // No risk of double-free
}
```

### Memory Leaks (Prevented)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    // s goes out of scope and is automatically freed
    // No risk of memory leaks
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Stack Performance

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack operations are very fast
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let z = x + y;
    println!("{}", z);
}
```

### Heap Performance

```rust
fn main() {
    // Heap operations are slower but necessary
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s.clone();  // Expensive - allocates new heap memory
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Avoiding Unnecessary Heap Allocations

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Use references instead of cloning
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length: {}", len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Stack vs Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack data
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;  // Copy
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);

    // Heap data
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // Move
    // println!("{}", s1);  // Error
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Exercise 2: Memory Management

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Exercise 3: Avoiding Moves

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let first_char = get_first_char(&s);
    println!("First character: {}", first_char);
    println!("String: {}", s);  // s is still valid
}

fn get_first_char(s: &String) -> char {
    s.chars().next().unwrap()
}
```

### Exercise 4: Memory Layout

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    let area = calculate_area(&rect);
    println!("Rectangle: {}x{}, Area: {}", rect.width, rect.height, area);
}

fn calculate_area(rect: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rect.width * rect.height
}
```
