# Ownership Rules

Master Rust's ownership system with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is Ownership in Rust?

**What**: Ownership is Rust's unique memory management system that ensures memory safety without garbage collection. It's a set of rules that the Rust compiler enforces at compile time to prevent memory-related bugs.

**Why**: Understanding ownership is crucial because:

- **Memory safety** prevents common bugs like use-after-free, double-free, and memory leaks
- **No garbage collector** means predictable performance without runtime overhead
- **Compile-time guarantees** catch memory issues before your program runs
- **Zero-cost abstractions** provide safety without performance penalties
- **Concurrency safety** prevents data races in multi-threaded programs

**When**: Use ownership concepts when:

- Working with heap-allocated data (like `String`, `Vec`, etc.)
- Passing data between functions
- Managing memory in your Rust programs
- Building complex data structures
- Writing concurrent or parallel code
- Ensuring your programs are memory-safe

**How**: Ownership works in Rust by:

- **Tracking ownership** of each value through a single owner
- **Enforcing rules** at compile time to prevent invalid memory access
- **Automatic cleanup** when values go out of scope
- **Move semantics** transferring ownership between variables
- **Copy semantics** for simple types that can be duplicated

**Where**: Ownership is used throughout Rust programs, from simple variable assignments to complex data structures and function calls.

## The Three Ownership Rules

**What**: Rust's ownership system is built on three fundamental rules that the compiler enforces.

**Why**: These rules are essential because:

- **Memory safety** prevents common programming errors
- **Predictable behavior** makes programs easier to reason about
- **Performance** enables efficient memory management
- **Concurrency safety** prevents data races
- **Resource management** ensures proper cleanup of resources

**When**: These rules apply whenever you work with values in Rust, especially heap-allocated data.

**How**: The three rules work together to ensure memory safety:

1. **Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its _owner_**
2. **There can only be one owner at a time**
3. **When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped**

**Where**: These rules are enforced by the Rust compiler throughout your entire program.

## Rule 1: Each Value Has One Owner

**What**: The first ownership rule states that every value in Rust has exactly one variable that owns it.

**Why**: This rule is important because:

- **Clear ownership** makes it obvious who is responsible for a value
- **Memory safety** prevents multiple variables from trying to free the same memory
- **Predictable behavior** ensures you always know who owns what
- **Resource management** makes cleanup straightforward
- **Debugging** makes it easier to track down memory issues

**When**: This rule applies whenever you create a new value in Rust, especially heap-allocated data.

**How**: The compiler tracks ownership by associating each value with exactly one variable.

**Where**: This rule is enforced throughout your entire Rust program.

### Basic Ownership

**What**: A simple example showing how a variable becomes the owner of a value.

**How**: Here's how basic ownership works:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s owns the string
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope, string is dropped
```

**Explanation**:

- `let s = String::from("hello");` creates a new `String` on the heap
- The variable `s` becomes the owner of this string
- `println!("{}", s);` uses the string through its owner
- When `s` goes out of scope (at the end of the function), the string is automatically dropped
- The memory is freed automatically, preventing memory leaks

**Why**: This demonstrates the fundamental concept that every value has exactly one owner, and the owner is responsible for the value's lifetime.

### Ownership Transfer

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved to s2, s1 is no longer valid

    // println!("{}", s1);  // This would cause a compile error!
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Ownership with Different Types

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer types implement Copy trait
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;  // x is copied, not moved
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // Both are valid

    // String type does not implement Copy
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1);  // Error: s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

## Rule 2: Only One Owner at a Time

### Multiple Ownership Attempts

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved to s2

    // This won't compile - s1 is no longer valid
    // let s3 = s1;  // Error: use of moved value

    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

### Ownership in Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);  // s is moved into the function

    // println!("{}", s);  // Error: s is no longer valid

    let x = 5;
    makes_copy(x);  // x is copied into the function
    println!("x: {}", x);  // x is still valid
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
}  // some_string goes out of scope and is dropped

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) {
    println!("{}", some_integer);
}  // some_integer goes out of scope, but i32 implements Copy
```

### Return Values and Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();  // s1 gets ownership
    let s2 = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved, s3 gets ownership

    println!("s1: {}", s1);
    println!("s3: {}", s3);
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    let some_string = String::from("hello");
    some_string  // some_string is moved out
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
    a_string  // a_string is moved out
}
```

## Rule 3: Values Are Dropped When Owner Goes Out of Scope

### Scope and Drop

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope, String is dropped
```

### Nested Scopes

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    {
        let s2 = String::from("world");  // s2 comes into scope
        println!("{}", s2);
    }  // s2 goes out of scope, String is dropped

    println!("{}", s);  // s is still valid
}  // s goes out of scope, String is dropped
```

### Function Scope

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);  // s is moved into function
    // s is no longer valid here
}

fn takes_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s goes out of scope, String is dropped
```

## Copy vs Move

### Types That Implement Copy

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer types
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;  // x is copied
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);

    // Boolean
    let b1 = true;
    let b2 = b1;  // b1 is copied
    println!("b1: {}, b2: {}", b1, b2);

    // Character
    let c1 = 'a';
    let c2 = c1;  // c1 is copied
    println!("c1: {}, c2: {}", c1, c2);

    // Tuples of Copy types
    let t1 = (1, 2, 3);
    let t2 = t1;  // t1 is copied
    println!("t1: {:?}, t2: {:?}", t1, t2);
}
```

### Types That Don't Implement Copy

```rust
fn main() {
    // String
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved
    // println!("{}", s1);  // Error: s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);

    // Vector
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let v2 = v1;  // v1 is moved
    // println!("{:?}", v1);  // Error: v1 is no longer valid
    println!("{:?}", v2);
}
```

## Ownership in Practice

### Avoiding Moves

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();  // Explicitly clone s1

    println!("s1: {}", s1);  // s1 is still valid
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}
```

### Function Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    print_string(s);  // s is moved
    // print_string(s);  // Error: s is no longer valid
}

fn print_string(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}  // s is dropped here
```

### Returning Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = takes_and_returns(s1);  // s1 is moved, s2 gets ownership
    println!("{}", s2);
}

fn takes_and_returns(s: String) -> String {
    println!("{}", s);
    s  // Return s, transferring ownership back
}
```

## Common Ownership Patterns

### Avoiding Unnecessary Moves

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Don't do this - s is moved
    // let len = calculate_length(s);
    // println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);  // Error!

    // Do this instead - use references
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Multiple Returns

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let (s2, len) = calculate_length_and_return(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length_and_return(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len();
    (s, length)  // Return both the string and its length
}
```

## Ownership and Memory

### Stack vs Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    // Stack-allocated data
    let x = 5;  // i32 on stack
    let y = x;  // Copy of x on stack

    // Heap-allocated data
    let s1 = String::from("hello");  // String on heap
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved, s2 now owns the heap data
}
```

### Memory Safety

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    // Rust ensures s is dropped when it goes out of scope
    // No memory leaks, no double-free, no use-after-free
}
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is moved to s2

    // This won't compile
    // println!("s1: {}", s1);
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}
```

### Exercise 2: Function Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);
    // s is no longer valid here
}

fn takes_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

### Exercise 3: Return Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = gives_ownership();
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s1);

    println!("s2: {}", s2);
    println!("s3: {}", s3);
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    String::from("world")
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(s: String) -> String {
    s
}
```

### Exercise 4: Copy vs Move

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;  // Copy
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // Move
    // println!("s1: {}", s1);  // Error
    println!("s2: {}", s2);
}
```
