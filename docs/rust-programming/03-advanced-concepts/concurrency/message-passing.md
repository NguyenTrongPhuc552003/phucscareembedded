# Message Passing

Master advanced thread communication patterns with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is Message Passing?

**What**: Message passing is a concurrency paradigm where threads communicate by sending and receiving messages through channels, rather than sharing mutable state. This approach eliminates many common concurrency problems like data races and deadlocks.

**Why**: Understanding message passing is crucial because:

- **Eliminates data races** by avoiding shared mutable state
- **Prevents deadlocks** by using asynchronous communication
- **Simplifies reasoning** about concurrent programs
- **Enables scalable architectures** with clear communication boundaries
- **Follows Rust's philosophy** of "fearless concurrency"

**When**: Use message passing when you need to:

- Communicate between threads without shared state
- Implement producer-consumer patterns
- Create event-driven architectures
- Build distributed systems
- Avoid the complexity of shared memory synchronization

**How**: Rust provides message passing through the `std::sync::mpsc` module, which offers multiple producer, single consumer channels.

**Where**: Message passing is used throughout Rust programs for thread communication, event handling, and building concurrent systems.

## Understanding Channel Types

### Asynchronous Channels

**What**: Asynchronous channels provide unbounded buffering and non-blocking sends.

**How**: Here's how to use asynchronous channels:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Producer threads
    for i in 0..3 {
        let tx_clone = tx.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..5 {
                let message = format!("Producer {}: Message {}", i, j);
                println!("Sending: {}", message);
                tx_clone.send(message).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer thread
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for received in rx {
            println!("Received: {}", received);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200));
        }
    });

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close the channel
    drop(tx);

    // Wait for consumer to finish
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `mpsc::channel()` creates an asynchronous channel
- `tx.clone()` creates additional transmitters for multiple producers
- `send()` is non-blocking and can queue messages
- The channel acts as an unbounded buffer
- `drop(tx)` closes the channel, signaling no more messages

**Why**: Asynchronous channels are ideal for scenarios where producers can generate messages faster than consumers can process them.

### Synchronous Channels

**What**: Synchronous channels provide bounded buffering and blocking sends when the buffer is full.

**How**: Here's how to use synchronous channels:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // Create a synchronous channel with capacity 3
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(3);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Producer threads
    for i in 0..2 {
        let tx_clone = tx.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..5 {
                let message = format!("Producer {}: Message {}", i, j);
                println!("Sending: {}", message);
                tx_clone.send(message).unwrap(); // Blocks when buffer is full
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer thread
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for received in rx {
            println!("Received: {}", received);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(2000));
        }
    });

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close the channel
    drop(tx);

    // Wait for consumer to finish
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `mpsc::sync_channel(3)` creates a synchronous channel with capacity 3
- `send()` blocks when the buffer is full
- This provides backpressure control
- Producers will block when trying to send the 4th message
- This prevents memory buildup from fast producers and slow consumers

**Why**: Synchronous channels provide flow control and prevent memory issues with fast producers.

### Channel Selection and Timeouts

**What**: You can select between multiple channels and set timeouts for operations.

**How**: Here's how to use channel selection:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

fn main() {
    let (tx1, rx1) = mpsc::channel();
    let (tx2, rx2) = mpsc::channel();

    // Producer 1
    let tx1_clone = tx1.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=3 {
            tx1_clone.send(format!("Channel 1: Message {}", i)).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
        }
    });

    // Producer 2
    let tx2_clone = tx2.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=3 {
            tx2_clone.send(format!("Channel 2: Message {}", i)).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1500));
        }
    });

    // Consumer with selection
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let start = Instant::now();
        let timeout = Duration::from_secs(10);

        loop {
            if start.elapsed() > timeout {
                println!("Timeout reached, stopping consumer");
                break;
            }

            // Try to receive from both channels with timeout
            match rx1.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(100)) {
                Ok(msg) => println!("Received from channel 1: {}", msg),
                Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Timeout) => {
                    // Try channel 2
                    match rx2.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(100)) {
                        Ok(msg) => println!("Received from channel 2: {}", msg),
                        Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Timeout) => {
                            // Both channels are empty, continue
                        }
                        Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected) => {
                            println!("Channel 2 disconnected");
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected) => {
                    println!("Channel 1 disconnected");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    });

    // Wait for consumer to finish
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `recv_timeout()` allows receiving with a timeout
- `RecvTimeoutError::Timeout` indicates no message was received within the timeout
- `RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected` indicates the channel is closed
- This pattern allows handling multiple channels efficiently
- Timeouts prevent the consumer from blocking indefinitely

**Why**: Channel selection and timeouts enable robust communication patterns that can handle multiple channels and prevent blocking.

## Understanding Advanced Communication Patterns

### Request-Response Pattern

**What**: The request-response pattern allows threads to send requests and receive responses through separate channels.

**How**: Here's how to implement request-response communication:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Request {
    id: u32,
    data: String,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Response {
    id: u32,
    result: String,
}

fn main() {
    let (request_tx, request_rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let (response_tx, response_rx) = mpsc::channel();

    // Worker thread that processes requests
    let worker_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for request in request_rx {
            println!("Worker received request: {:?}", request);

            // Simulate processing
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));

            // Send response
            let response = Response {
                id: request.id,
                result: format!("Processed: {}", request.data),
            };

            response_tx.send(response).unwrap();
        }
    });

    // Client threads that send requests
    let mut client_handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..3 {
        let request_tx_clone = request_tx.clone();
        let response_rx_clone = response_rx.clone();

        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..2 {
                let request = Request {
                    id: i * 10 + j,
                    data: format!("Client {}: Request {}", i, j),
                };

                println!("Client {} sending request: {:?}", i, request);
                request_tx_clone.send(request).unwrap();

                // Wait for response
                if let Ok(response) = response_rx_clone.recv() {
                    println!("Client {} received response: {:?}", i, response);
                }
            }
        });

        client_handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all clients to complete
    for handle in client_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close request channel
    drop(request_tx);

    // Wait for worker to finish
    worker_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Two separate channels: one for requests, one for responses
- Worker thread processes requests and sends responses
- Client threads send requests and wait for responses
- Each request has a unique ID for matching with responses
- This pattern is common in client-server architectures

**Why**: The request-response pattern enables structured communication where each request gets a corresponding response.

### Event Broadcasting Pattern

**What**: The event broadcasting pattern allows multiple subscribers to receive events from a single publisher.

**How**: Here's how to implement event broadcasting:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Event {
    id: u32,
    message: String,
    timestamp: std::time::SystemTime,
}

struct EventBroadcaster {
    subscribers: Arc<Mutex<Vec<mpsc::Sender<Event>>>>,
}

impl EventBroadcaster {
    fn new() -> Self {
        EventBroadcaster {
            subscribers: Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new())),
        }
    }

    fn subscribe(&self) -> mpsc::Receiver<Event> {
        let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
        self.subscribers.lock().unwrap().push(tx);
        rx
    }

    fn broadcast(&self, event: Event) {
        let subscribers = self.subscribers.lock().unwrap();
        for subscriber in subscribers.iter() {
            let _ = subscriber.send(event.clone());
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let broadcaster = Arc::new(EventBroadcaster::new());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Create subscriber threads
    for i in 0..3 {
        let broadcaster_clone = Arc::clone(&broadcaster);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let rx = broadcaster_clone.subscribe();
            println!("Subscriber {} started", i);

            for event in rx {
                println!("Subscriber {} received: {:?}", i, event);
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Publisher thread
    let broadcaster_clone = Arc::clone(&broadcaster);
    let publisher_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=5 {
            let event = Event {
                id: i,
                message: format!("Event {}", i),
                timestamp: std::time::SystemTime::now(),
            };

            println!("Broadcasting: {:?}", event);
            broadcaster_clone.broadcast(event);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
        }
    });

    // Wait for publisher to complete
    publisher_handle.join().unwrap();

    // Give subscribers time to process
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(2000));
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `EventBroadcaster` manages a list of subscribers
- `subscribe()` adds a new subscriber and returns a receiver
- `broadcast()` sends the same event to all subscribers
- Each subscriber gets its own channel for receiving events
- This pattern is common in event-driven architectures

**Why**: Event broadcasting enables decoupled communication where one publisher can notify multiple subscribers.

### Pipeline Pattern

**What**: The pipeline pattern processes data through a series of stages, where each stage passes data to the next.

**How**: Here's how to implement a data processing pipeline:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct DataItem {
    id: u32,
    value: i32,
    stage: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let (input_tx, input_rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let (stage1_tx, stage1_rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let (stage2_tx, stage2_rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let (output_tx, output_rx) = mpsc::channel();

    // Input stage
    let input_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=10 {
            let item = DataItem {
                id: i,
                value: i * 10,
                stage: 0,
            };
            println!("Input: {:?}", item);
            input_tx.send(item).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        }
    });

    // Stage 1: Multiply by 2
    let stage1_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for mut item in input_rx {
            item.value *= 2;
            item.stage = 1;
            println!("Stage 1: {:?}", item);
            stage1_tx.send(item).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(300));
        }
    });

    // Stage 2: Add 100
    let stage2_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for mut item in stage1_rx {
            item.value += 100;
            item.stage = 2;
            println!("Stage 2: {:?}", item);
            stage2_tx.send(item).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200));
        }
    });

    // Output stage
    let output_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for item in stage2_rx {
            println!("Output: {:?}", item);
            output_tx.send(item).unwrap();
        }
    });

    // Wait for all stages to complete
    input_handle.join().unwrap();
    stage1_handle.join().unwrap();
    stage2_handle.join().unwrap();
    output_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Each stage processes data and passes it to the next stage
- Data flows through the pipeline: input → stage1 → stage2 → output
- Each stage can have different processing times
- The pipeline processes data concurrently
- This pattern is common in data processing systems

**Why**: The pipeline pattern enables efficient data processing by parallelizing different stages of computation.

## Understanding Error Handling in Message Passing

### Channel Disconnection Handling

**What**: Channels can be disconnected when all senders are dropped, and you need to handle this gracefully.

**How**: Here's how to handle channel disconnection:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Producer threads
    for i in 0..3 {
        let tx_clone = tx.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..3 {
                let message = format!("Producer {}: Message {}", i, j);
                println!("Sending: {}", message);

                match tx_clone.send(message) {
                    Ok(_) => println!("Sent successfully"),
                    Err(e) => println!("Failed to send: {}", e),
                }

                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer thread
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            match rx.recv() {
                Ok(message) => println!("Received: {}", message),
                Err(mpsc::RecvError) => {
                    println!("Channel disconnected, stopping consumer");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    });

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close the channel by dropping the transmitter
    drop(tx);

    // Wait for consumer to finish
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `send()` returns `Result<(), SendError<T>>` indicating success or failure
- `recv()` returns `Result<T, RecvError>` indicating success or disconnection
- `RecvError` indicates the channel is disconnected
- Graceful handling prevents panics and allows clean shutdown

**Why**: Proper error handling ensures your concurrent programs can handle failures gracefully.

### Timeout Handling

**What**: You can set timeouts for channel operations to prevent indefinite blocking.

**How**: Here's how to use timeouts with channels:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Producer threads
    for i in 0..2 {
        let tx_clone = tx.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..3 {
                let message = format!("Producer {}: Message {}", i, j);
                println!("Sending: {}", message);

                // Try to send with timeout
                match tx_clone.send_timeout(message, Duration::from_millis(1000)) {
                    Ok(_) => println!("Sent successfully"),
                    Err(mpsc::SendTimeoutError::Timeout(_)) => {
                        println!("Send timeout, message dropped");
                    }
                    Err(mpsc::SendTimeoutError::Disconnected(_)) => {
                        println!("Channel disconnected");
                        break;
                    }
                }

                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer thread
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            match rx.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(2000)) {
                Ok(message) => println!("Received: {}", message),
                Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Timeout) => {
                    println!("Receive timeout, no message available");
                }
                Err(mpsc::RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected) => {
                    println!("Channel disconnected, stopping consumer");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    });

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close the channel
    drop(tx);

    // Wait for consumer to finish
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `send_timeout()` allows sending with a timeout
- `recv_timeout()` allows receiving with a timeout
- `SendTimeoutError::Timeout` indicates the send operation timed out
- `RecvTimeoutError::Timeout` indicates no message was received within the timeout
- Timeouts prevent indefinite blocking and enable responsive systems

**Why**: Timeout handling enables responsive systems that can handle slow or unresponsive components.

## Understanding Performance Considerations

### Channel Performance Characteristics

**What**: Different channel types have different performance characteristics that affect your choice.

**How**: Here's how to understand channel performance:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

fn benchmark_channels() {
    let iterations = 100_000;

    // Benchmark asynchronous channel
    let start = Instant::now();
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let producer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..iterations {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
    });

    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..iterations {
            rx.recv().unwrap();
        }
    });

    producer_handle.join().unwrap();
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();

    let async_duration = start.elapsed();
    println!("Asynchronous channel: {:?}", async_duration);

    // Benchmark synchronous channel
    let start = Instant::now();
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(1000); // Buffer size 1000

    let producer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..iterations {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
    });

    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..iterations {
            rx.recv().unwrap();
        }
    });

    producer_handle.join().unwrap();
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();

    let sync_duration = start.elapsed();
    println!("Synchronous channel: {:?}", sync_duration);

    println!("Performance ratio: {:.2}x",
             sync_duration.as_nanos() as f64 / async_duration.as_nanos() as f64);
}

fn main() {
    benchmark_channels();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Asynchronous channels are generally faster for high-throughput scenarios
- Synchronous channels provide backpressure control but may be slower
- Buffer size affects synchronous channel performance
- The choice depends on your specific use case and requirements

**Why**: Understanding performance characteristics helps you choose the right channel type for your application.

### Memory Usage Patterns

**What**: Different channel types have different memory usage patterns.

**How**: Here's how to understand memory usage:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn memory_usage_example() {
    // Asynchronous channel - unbounded memory usage
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    // Fast producer, slow consumer
    let producer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..1_000_000 {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
            if i % 100_000 == 0 {
                println!("Produced: {}", i);
            }
        }
    });

    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut count = 0;
        for _ in rx {
            count += 1;
            if count % 100_000 == 0 {
                println!("Consumed: {}", count);
            }
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)); // Slow consumer
        }
    });

    producer_handle.join().unwrap();
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    memory_usage_example();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Asynchronous channels can use unbounded memory if producers are faster than consumers
- Synchronous channels provide memory bounds through their buffer size
- Memory usage depends on the producer-consumer speed ratio
- Consider using synchronous channels when memory usage is a concern

**Why**: Understanding memory usage patterns helps you design systems that don't run out of memory.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Message Passing

**What**: Create a simple producer-consumer system using channels.

**How**: Implement this program:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    // Producer
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=5 {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        }
    });

    // Consumer
    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }
}
```

### Exercise 2: Multiple Producers

**What**: Create a system with multiple producers and one consumer.

**How**: Implement this program:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Multiple producers
    for i in 0..3 {
        let tx_clone = tx.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..3 {
                tx_clone.send(format!("Producer {}: Message {}", i, j)).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer
    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

### Exercise 3: Synchronous Channel

**What**: Create a system using synchronous channels with backpressure control.

**How**: Implement this program:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(2); // Buffer size 2

    // Fast producer
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=10 {
            println!("Sending: {}", i);
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
    });

    // Slow consumer
    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways
