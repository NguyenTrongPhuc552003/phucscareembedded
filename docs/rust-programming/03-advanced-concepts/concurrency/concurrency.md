# Concurrency

Master safe concurrent programming in Rust with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What Is Concurrency?

**What**: Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple operations simultaneously, either through multiple threads or asynchronous programming. Rust provides powerful tools for safe concurrent programming without data races.

**Why**: Understanding concurrency is crucial because:

- **Performance** enables parallel processing and better resource utilization
- **Responsiveness** allows programs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Scalability** enables applications to handle more users and requests
- **Real-time systems** require concurrent processing for time-sensitive operations
- **Modern computing** leverages multi-core processors effectively
- **User experience** provides responsive interfaces and background processing

**When**: Use concurrency when you need to:

- Process large amounts of data in parallel
- Handle multiple user requests simultaneously
- Perform background tasks while maintaining responsiveness
- Utilize multiple CPU cores effectively
- Build real-time systems with timing requirements
- Create responsive user interfaces

**How**: Concurrency works in Rust by:

- **Threads** for parallel execution with shared memory
- **Message passing** for communication between threads
- **Async programming** for efficient I/O-bound operations
- **Synchronization primitives** for safe data sharing
- **Ownership system** preventing data races at compile time

**Where**: Concurrency is used throughout Rust programs for web servers, data processing, real-time systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Understanding Threads

### Basic Thread Creation

**What**: Threads allow you to run code concurrently by creating separate execution contexts.

**Why**: Understanding threads is important because:

- **Parallel execution** enables multiple operations to run simultaneously
- **CPU utilization** makes better use of multi-core processors
- **Responsiveness** allows background processing while maintaining UI responsiveness
- **Performance** can significantly improve program speed
- **Real-time systems** require concurrent processing for timing requirements

**When**: Use threads when you need to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel.

**How**: Here's how to create and use threads:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    println!("Main thread starting");

    // Create a new thread
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..=5 {
            println!("Thread: {}", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
        }
    });

    // Main thread continues executing
    for i in 1..=3 {
        println!("Main: {}", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    }

    // Wait for the spawned thread to complete
    handle.join().unwrap();

    println!("All threads completed");
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `thread::spawn(|| { ... })` creates a new thread with a closure
- The closure contains the code that will run in the new thread
- `handle.join().unwrap()` waits for the thread to complete
- Both threads run concurrently, printing their respective messages
- `thread::sleep()` simulates work being done

**Why**: Threads enable parallel execution, allowing your program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Threads with Data

**What**: You can pass data to threads using the `move` keyword to transfer ownership.

**Why**: Understanding data transfer to threads is important because:

- **Data sharing** allows threads to work with specific data
- **Ownership transfer** ensures thread safety
- **Performance** enables parallel processing of large datasets
- **Isolation** prevents data races between threads

**When**: Use data transfer when you need threads to work with specific data.

**How**: Here's how to pass data to threads:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Move data to the thread
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let sum: i32 = data.iter().sum();
        println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    });

    // data is no longer available in main thread
    // println!("{:?}", data);  // This would cause a compile error

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `move` keyword transfers ownership of `data` to the thread
- The thread becomes the owner of the data
- The main thread can no longer access the data
- This prevents data races and ensures thread safety
- The thread can safely process the data without interference

**Why**: Moving data to threads ensures thread safety by preventing multiple threads from accessing the same data simultaneously.

### Multiple Threads

**What**: You can create multiple threads to process different parts of a task.

**How**: Here's how to create multiple threads:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Create multiple threads
    for i in 1..=5 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("Thread {} starting", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100 * i));
            println!("Thread {} finished", i);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("All threads completed");
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `for i in 1..=5` creates 5 threads
- Each thread has its own identifier and sleep duration
- `handles.push(handle)` stores thread handles for later joining
- `handle.join().unwrap()` waits for each thread to complete
- All threads run concurrently with different timing

**Why**: Multiple threads enable parallel processing of independent tasks, improving overall performance.

## Understanding Message Passing

### Channels for Communication

**What**: Channels allow threads to communicate by sending and receiving messages.

**Why**: Understanding message passing is important because:

- **Thread safety** prevents data races by avoiding shared memory
- **Communication** enables coordination between threads
- **Isolation** keeps threads independent and safe
- **Scalability** allows easy addition of more threads
- **Debugging** makes concurrent programs easier to reason about

**When**: Use message passing when you need threads to communicate or coordinate.

**How**: Here's how to use channels for thread communication:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Create a channel
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();

    // Spawn a thread that sends data
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        for value in data {
            sender.send(value).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        }
    });

    // Receive data in the main thread
    for received in receiver {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `mpsc::channel()` creates a multi-producer, single-consumer channel
- `sender` is moved to the spawned thread
- `receiver` remains in the main thread
- `sender.send(value)` sends data to the channel
- `receiver` iterates over received values
- The channel automatically closes when the sender is dropped

**Why**: Channels provide a safe way for threads to communicate without shared memory.

### Multiple Producers

**What**: You can have multiple threads sending data to the same receiver.

**How**: Here's how to use multiple producers:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Create multiple producer threads
    for i in 1..=3 {
        let sender_clone = sender.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 1..=3 {
                sender_clone.send(format!("Thread {}: Message {}", i, j)).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Drop the original sender to close the channel
    drop(sender);

    // Receive all messages
    for message in receiver {
        println!("{}", message);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `sender.clone()` creates additional senders for other threads
- Multiple threads can send data to the same receiver
- `drop(sender)` closes the channel when all producers are done
- The receiver collects messages from all producers
- Each thread sends its own sequence of messages

**Why**: Multiple producers enable parallel data generation and processing.

### Bounded Channels

**What**: Bounded channels have a limited capacity, providing backpressure control.

**How**: Here's how to use bounded channels:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Create a bounded channel with capacity 2
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::sync_channel(2);

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..=5 {
            println!("Sending: {}", i);
            sender.send(i).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        }
    });

    // Receive data with delays
    for received in receiver {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
        thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `mpsc::sync_channel(2)` creates a bounded channel with capacity 2
- The sender will block when the channel is full
- This provides backpressure control
- The receiver processes data at its own pace
- The channel acts as a buffer between producer and consumer

**Why**: Bounded channels prevent memory issues and provide flow control in concurrent systems.

## Understanding Shared State

### Mutex for Synchronization

**What**: Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) allows threads to safely access shared data one at a time.

**Why**: Understanding Mutex is important because:

- **Thread safety** prevents data races when multiple threads access shared data
- **Synchronization** ensures only one thread can modify data at a time
- **Data integrity** prevents corruption from concurrent access
- **Performance** provides efficient synchronization for shared resources
- **Deadlock prevention** requires careful design to avoid deadlocks

**When**: Use Mutex when you need multiple threads to safely access shared data.

**How**: Here's how to use Mutex for thread-safe data access:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Final count: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `Mutex::new(0)` creates a mutex-protected integer
- `counter.clone()` creates a reference to the same mutex
- `counter.lock().unwrap()` acquires a lock on the mutex
- Only one thread can hold the lock at a time
- The lock is automatically released when the guard goes out of scope

**Why**: Mutex ensures thread-safe access to shared data by allowing only one thread at a time.

### Arc for Shared Ownership

**What**: Arc (Atomically Reference Counted) allows multiple threads to own the same data.

**How**: Here's how to use Arc with Mutex:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Final count: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `Arc::new(Mutex::new(0))` creates a reference-counted mutex
- `Arc::clone(&counter)` creates a new reference to the same data
- Multiple threads can own references to the same mutex
- The mutex is automatically freed when the last reference is dropped
- This combination provides both shared ownership and thread safety

**Why**: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt; enables safe sharing of mutable data between multiple threads.

### RwLock for Read-Write Access

**What**: RwLock (Read-Write Lock) allows multiple readers or one writer at a time.

**How**: Here's how to use RwLock for efficient read-write access:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Create reader threads
    for i in 0..5 {
        let data = Arc::clone(&data);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let value = data.read().unwrap();
            println!("Reader {}: {}", i, *value);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Create writer thread
    let data = Arc::clone(&data);
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut value = data.write().unwrap();
        *value += 10;
        println!("Writer: {}", *value);
    });
    handles.push(handle);

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `RwLock::new(0)` creates a read-write lock
- `data.read().unwrap()` acquires a read lock (multiple readers allowed)
- `data.write().unwrap()` acquires a write lock (exclusive access)
- Readers can access data concurrently
- Writers have exclusive access
- This provides better performance for read-heavy workloads

**Why**: RwLock provides efficient access patterns for data that is read more often than written.

## Understanding Async Programming

### Basic Async/Await

**What**: Async programming allows you to write concurrent code that's more efficient than threads for I/O-bound operations.

**Why**: Understanding async programming is important because:

- **Efficiency** provides better resource utilization for I/O-bound tasks
- **Scalability** enables handling thousands of concurrent operations
- **Performance** reduces overhead compared to threads
- **Modern programming** is essential for web servers and network applications
- **User experience** enables responsive applications

**When**: Use async programming for I/O-bound operations like network requests, file operations, and database queries.

**How**: Here's how to use basic async/await:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use tokio::time::sleep;

async fn async_function() -> i32 {
    println!("Async function starting");
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await;
    println!("Async function completed");
    42
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Main function starting");

    let result = async_function().await;
    println!("Result: {}", result);

    println!("Main function completed");
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `async fn` defines an asynchronous function
- `sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await` pauses execution without blocking
- `async_function().await` waits for the async function to complete
- `#[tokio::main]` sets up the async runtime
- Async functions return futures that can be awaited

**Why**: Async programming provides efficient concurrency for I/O-bound operations.

### Concurrent Async Operations

**What**: You can run multiple async operations concurrently using `join!` or `select!`.

**How**: Here's how to run concurrent async operations:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use tokio::time::sleep;

async fn task1() -> i32 {
    println!("Task 1 starting");
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await;
    println!("Task 1 completed");
    1
}

async fn task2() -> i32 {
    println!("Task 2 starting");
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(1500)).await;
    println!("Task 2 completed");
    2
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Starting concurrent tasks");

    // Run tasks concurrently
    let (result1, result2) = tokio::join!(task1(), task2());

    println!("Results: {}, {}", result1, result2);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `task1()` and `task2()` are async functions that run concurrently
- `tokio::join!(task1(), task2())` runs both tasks simultaneously
- Both tasks start at the same time and run in parallel
- The function waits for both tasks to complete
- This is more efficient than running tasks sequentially

**Why**: Concurrent async operations enable efficient parallel processing of I/O-bound tasks.

### Async with Channels

**What**: You can use channels with async programming for communication between async tasks.

**How**: Here's how to use channels with async:

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

async fn producer(mut sender: mpsc::Sender<i32>) {
    for i in 1..=5 {
        sender.send(i).await.unwrap();
        println!("Sent: {}", i);
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    }
}

async fn consumer(mut receiver: mpsc::Receiver<i32>) {
    while let Some(value) = receiver.recv().await {
        println!("Received: {}", value);
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(10);

    tokio::join!(
        producer(sender),
        consumer(receiver)
    );
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `mpsc::channel(10)` creates an async channel with capacity 10
- `sender.send(i).await` sends data asynchronously
- `receiver.recv().await` receives data asynchronously
- `tokio::join!` runs both producer and consumer concurrently
- Async channels provide efficient communication between async tasks

**Why**: Async channels enable efficient communication between concurrent async tasks.

## Common Concurrency Patterns

### Worker Pool Pattern

**What**: A worker pool uses a fixed number of threads to process tasks from a queue.

**How**: Here's how to implement a worker pool:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

type Job = Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send + 'static>;

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Self {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || loop {
            let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();
            match job {
                Ok(job) => {
                    println!("Worker {} got a job", id);
                    job();
                }
                Err(_) => {
                    println!("Worker {} shutting down", id);
                    break;
                }
            }
        });

        Worker { id, thread }
    }
}

struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: mpsc::Sender<Job>,
}

impl ThreadPool {
    fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
        let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);
        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id, Arc::clone(&receiver)));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers, sender }
    }

    fn execute<F>(&self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
        let job = Box::new(f);
        self.sender.send(job).unwrap();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for i in 0..8 {
        pool.execute(move || {
            println!("Task {} executed", i);
            thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        });
    }

    thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1000));
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `Worker` struct represents a worker thread
- `ThreadPool` manages a fixed number of workers
- `Job` type represents a task to be executed
- Workers continuously process jobs from the queue
- The pool provides a simple interface for executing tasks

**Why**: Worker pools provide efficient task processing with controlled resource usage.

### Producer-Consumer Pattern

**What**: The producer-consumer pattern uses channels to coordinate between data producers and consumers.

**How**: Here's how to implement the producer-consumer pattern:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Producer threads
    for i in 1..=3 {
        let sender = sender.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 1..=5 {
                let data = format!("Producer {}: Item {}", i, j);
                sender.send(data).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Consumer thread
    let consumer_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        for received in receiver {
            println!("Consumed: {}", received);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
        }
    });

    // Wait for all producers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Close the channel
    drop(sender);

    // Wait for consumer to complete
    consumer_handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Multiple producer threads generate data
- A single consumer thread processes the data
- The channel acts as a buffer between producers and consumer
- Producers can work at their own pace
- The consumer processes data as it becomes available

**Why**: The producer-consumer pattern provides efficient coordination between data generation and processing.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Thread-Safe Counter

**What**: Create a thread-safe counter using Arc and Mutex.

**How**: Implement this counter:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Final count: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

### Exercise 2: Async File Processing

**What**: Create an async function that processes multiple files concurrently.

**How**: Implement this file processor:

```rust
use tokio::fs;
use tokio::time::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

async fn process_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    println!("Processing file: {}", filename);
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
    Ok(format!("Processed {}", filename))
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let files = vec!["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"];

    let mut handles = vec![];
    for file in files {
        let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
            process_file(file).await
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        let result = handle.await?;
        println!("Result: {}", result?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Exercise 3: Message Passing System

**What**: Create a system where multiple workers process messages from a queue.

**How**: Implement this message system:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Create worker threads
    for worker_id in 1..=3 {
        let receiver = receiver.clone();
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            for message in receiver {
                println!("Worker {} processing: {}", worker_id, message);
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Send messages
    for i in 1..=10 {
        sender.send(format!("Message {}", i)).unwrap();
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
    }

    // Close the channel
    drop(sender);

    // Wait for all workers to complete
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

## Key Takeaways

**What** you've learned about concurrency:

1. **Threads** - Parallel execution with shared memory and synchronization
2. **Message Passing** - Safe communication between threads using channels
3. **Shared State** - Thread-safe access to shared data with Mutex and Arc
4. **Async Programming** - Efficient concurrency for I/O-bound operations
5. **Synchronization** - Coordinating access to shared resources
6. **Common Patterns** - Worker pools, producer-consumer, and message systems
7. **Performance** - Choosing the right concurrency model for your use case
8. **Safety** - Rust's ownership system prevents data races at compile time

**Why** these concepts matter:

- **Performance** enables efficient utilization of modern multi-core systems
- **Scalability** allows applications to handle more users and requests
- **Responsiveness** provides better user experience with concurrent processing
- **Safety** prevents common concurrency bugs like data races and deadlocks
- **Modern programming** is essential for building high-performance applications
