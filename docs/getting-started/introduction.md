# Introduction to Embedded Development

Welcome to Phuc's comprehensive guide for Linux kernel development, Rust programming, and embedded Linux development! This documentation covers everything you need to know about developing for embedded systems, with a focus on the Rock 5B+ development board.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide provides structured learning paths across multiple domains:

### Linux Kernel Development

- **Phase 1 - Linux Kernel Fundamentals**: Master kernel architecture, process management, memory management, system calls, and ARM64 specifics for Rock 5B+
- **Phase 2 - Kernel Development Environment**: Set up cross-compilation toolchains, kernel build systems, debugging tools (GDB, KGDB), and testing frameworks for ARM64
- **Phase 3 - Kernel Modules and Device Drivers**: Develop loadable kernel modules, character devices, platform drivers, DMA operations, and interrupt handling
- **Phase 4 - Real-Time Linux Kernel**: Master PREEMPT_RT patch, real-time scheduling policies, latency measurement, and real-time applications on Rock 5B+
- **Phase 5 - Advanced Memory Management**: Learn page allocators, slab allocators, virtual memory, DMA operations, and memory debugging techniques
- **Phase 6 - Kernel Synchronization and Concurrency**: Master spinlocks, mutexes, RCU, atomic operations, workqueues, and deadlock prevention
- **Phase 7 - Kernel Security and Hardening**: Implement SELinux, capability system, ASLR/KASLR, secure boot, and security monitoring
- **Phase 8 - Advanced Kernel Topics and Projects**: Performance profiling, power management, kernel contribution process, and complete capstone projects

### Rust Programming

- **Phase 1 - Rust Basics**: Master variables, data types, functions, ownership, borrowing, references, and control flow fundamentals
- **Phase 2 - Rust Fundamentals**: Learn structs, enums, pattern matching, error handling, collections, modules, and package management
- **Phase 3 - Advanced Concepts**: Master generics, traits, lifetimes, smart pointers, iterators, closures, and advanced type system
- **Phase 4 - Embedded Rust**: Learn no_std programming, hardware abstraction layers, embedded HAL, peripheral access, and bare-metal development
- **Phase 5 - Systems Programming**: Master unsafe Rust, FFI with C, concurrency primitives, async/await, and system-level interfaces
- **Phase 6 - Performance Optimization**: Learn profiling tools, benchmarking, memory optimization, SIMD operations, and performance tuning
- **Phase 7 - Testing and Debugging**: Master unit testing, integration testing, property-based testing, debugging techniques, and production applications

### Embedded Linux Development

- **Phase 1 - Introduction to Embedded Linux**: Comprehensive overview of embedded systems, Linux fundamentals, development environment setup, and cross-compilation toolchains
- **Phase 2 - Linux Kernel and Device Drivers**: Deep dive into kernel architecture, device driver development, interrupt handling, memory management, and driver programming
- **Phase 3 - Bootloaders and Build Systems**: Master U-Boot configuration, Buildroot and Yocto Project, secure boot implementation, and build optimization
- **Phase 4 - Filesystems and Storage**: Explore filesystem fundamentals, flash memory management, MTD subsystem, JFFS2/UBIFS, and storage optimization
- **Phase 5 - Networking and Communication Protocols**: Learn network configuration, socket programming, I2C/SPI/UART, CAN bus, Modbus, and industrial protocols
- **Phase 6 - Real-Time Systems and Performance**: Implement real-time Linux with PREEMPT_RT, system profiling, performance tuning, and power management
- **Phase 7 - Security and Debugging**: Master embedded security, secure boot, cryptographic key management, system hardening, and debugging tools
- **Phase 8 - Project Development and Case Studies**: Complete capstone projects, implementation methodologies, industry case studies, and portfolio development

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Understanding of programming concepts (C programming recommended for kernel development)
