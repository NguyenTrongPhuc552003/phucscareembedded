# Real-Time Fundamentals

Master the fundamental concepts of real-time systems and understand how they differ from general-purpose computing systems, with specific focus on real-time Linux development for the Rock 5B+ platform.

## What are Real-Time Systems?

**What**: Real-time systems are computing systems that must respond to external events within strict timing constraints. These systems guarantee that critical tasks will be completed within their specified deadlines, making them essential for safety-critical and time-sensitive applications.

**Why**: Understanding real-time systems is crucial because:

- **Safety-critical applications** - Industrial control, medical devices, automotive systems
- **Time-sensitive operations** - Audio/video processing, robotics, automation
- **Predictable performance** - Guaranteed response times for critical tasks
- **System reliability** - Deterministic behavior under all conditions
- **Embedded development** - Essential for Rock 5B+ real-time applications
- **Professional development** - High-demand skill in embedded systems

**When**: Real-time systems are used when:

- **Hard deadlines** - Missing a deadline causes system failure or safety issues
- **Soft deadlines** - Missing a deadline degrades system performance
- **Critical applications** - Industrial automation, medical devices, aerospace
- **Interactive systems** - Audio processing, robotics, gaming
- **Control systems** - Process control, motor control, sensor networks
- **Safety systems** - Emergency shutdown, collision avoidance, life support

**How**: Real-time systems operate by:

- **Deterministic scheduling** - Predictable task execution order
- **Priority-based execution** - Critical tasks get higher priority
- **Interrupt handling** - Fast response to external events

- **Medical devices** - Pacemakers, infusion pumps, monitoring systems
- **Aerospace** - Flight control, navigation, communication systems
- **Robotics** - Real-time control loops, sensor processing
- **Rock 5B+** - ARM64 embedded real-time applications

## Hard vs Soft Real-Time

**What**: Real-time systems are classified into hard real-time and soft real-time based on the consequences of missing deadlines.

**Why**: Understanding the distinction is important because:

- **System design** - Different approaches for different requirements
- **Safety considerations** - Hard real-time for safety-critical systems
- **Performance trade-offs** - Balancing determinism with efficiency
- **Cost implications** - Hard real-time systems are more expensive
- **Application suitability** - Choosing the right approach for the task
- **Rock 5B+ development** - Understanding platform capabilities

**When**: The distinction matters when:

- **System specification** - Defining timing requirements
- **Architecture selection** - Choosing appropriate hardware and software
- **Performance analysis** - Evaluating system capabilities
- **Safety assessment** - Determining risk levels
- **Cost analysis** - Balancing requirements with resources
- **Development planning** - Setting realistic goals

**How**: The distinction works through:

```c
// Example: Hard real-time system characteristics
// Critical task with hard deadline
void critical_control_loop(void) {
    // Must complete within 1ms
    unsigned long start_time = get_time_us();

    // Critical control operations
    read_sensors();
    calculate_control_output();
    update_actuators();

    // Verify timing constraint
    unsigned long execution_time = get_time_us() - start_time;
    if (execution_time > 1000) {  // 1ms = 1000μs
        // System failure - hard deadline missed
        emergency_shutdown();
    }
}

// Example: Soft real-time system characteristics
// Non-critical task with soft deadline
void audio_processing_task(void) {
    // Should complete within 10ms
    unsigned long start_time = get_time_us();

    // Audio processing operations
    process_audio_buffer();
    apply_effects();
    output_audio();

    // Log performance but continue operation
    unsigned long execution_time = get_time_us() - start_time;
    if (execution_time > 10000) {  // 10ms = 10000μs
        // Performance degradation - soft deadline missed
        log_performance_issue();
        // Continue operation with degraded quality
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **Hard real-time** - Missing deadlines causes system failure
- **Soft real-time** - Missing deadlines degrades performance
- **Timing constraints** - Different tolerance levels for deadline misses
- **System response** - Different handling of timing violations
- **Safety implications** - Hard real-time for safety-critical systems

**Where**: The distinction applies in:

- **Safety-critical systems** - Hard real-time for life-safety applications
- **Performance-critical systems** - Soft real-time for quality-sensitive applications
- **Mixed systems** - Different subsystems with different requirements
- **Embedded systems** - Resource-constrained real-time applications
- **Rock 5B+** - ARM64 real-time development platform

**How**: Latency and jitter are measured through:

```c
// Example: Latency measurement
// Measure interrupt response latency
static unsigned long interrupt_latency_start;
static unsigned long interrupt_latency_end;
static unsigned long max_latency = 0;
static unsigned long min_latency = ULONG_MAX;
static unsigned long total_latency = 0;
static unsigned long latency_count = 0;

// Interrupt handler for latency measurement
irqreturn_t latency_test_handler(int irq, void *dev_id) {
    interrupt_latency_end = get_time_us();

    unsigned long latency = interrupt_latency_end - interrupt_latency_start;

    // Update statistics
    if (latency > max_latency)
        max_latency = latency;
    if (latency < min_latency)
        min_latency = latency;

    total_latency += latency;
    latency_count++;

    return IRQ_HANDLED;
}

// Trigger latency measurement
void trigger_latency_test(void) {
    interrupt_latency_start = get_time_us();
    // Trigger interrupt
    trigger_test_interrupt();
}

// Calculate jitter (timing variation)
void calculate_jitter(void) {
    unsigned long average_latency = total_latency / latency_count;
    unsigned long jitter = max_latency - min_latency;

    printk("Latency Statistics:\n");
    printk("  Min: %lu μs\n", min_latency);
    printk("  Max: %lu μs\n", max_latency);
    printk("  Avg: %lu μs\n", average_latency);
    printk("  Jitter: %lu μs\n", jitter);
}
```

        process_data_item(i);
    }

    // Guaranteed completion time
    unsigned long execution_time = get_time_us() - start_time;
    BUG_ON(execution_time > MAX_EXECUTION_TIME);
}

// 2. Priority-based scheduling
void high_priority_task(void) {
    // Set real-time priority

        wait_for_event();
        process_critical_data();
    }
}

    attr.sched_period = 2000000;      // 2ms period
    sched_setattr(0, &attr, 0);

    // Reserve memory
    void *reserved_memory = kmalloc(RESERVED_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
    BUG_ON(!reserved_memory);
}

// 4. Fault tolerance
void fault_tolerant_task(void) {
    int retry_count = 0;
    int max_retries = 3;

    while (retry_count < max_retries) {
        if (critical_operation() == SUCCESS) {
            break;
        }

        retry_count++;
        if (retry_count >= max_retries) {
            // Graceful degradation
