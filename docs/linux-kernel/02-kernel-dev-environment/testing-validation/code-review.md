# Code Review

Master code review processes and best practices to ensure high-quality kernel code on Rock 5B+ ARM64 systems.

## What is Code Review?

**What**: Code review is the systematic examination of source code by one or more people other than the author to identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards.

**Why**: Understanding code review is crucial because:

- **Quality assurance** - Ensure code meets quality standards
- **Knowledge sharing** - Share knowledge and best practices
- **Bug prevention** - Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Learning opportunity** - Learn from others' code and feedback
- **Team collaboration** - Improve team collaboration and communication

**When**: Code review is performed when:

- **Code submission** - Before code is merged into main branch
- **Feature development** - During feature development process
- **Bug fixes** - When fixing bugs and issues
- **Refactoring** - During code refactoring
- **Learning** - As a learning and knowledge sharing activity

**How**: Code review works through:

```bash
# Example: Code review workflow
# 1. Create patch
git format-patch -1 HEAD

# 2. Send patch for review
git send-email --to=linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org patch.diff

# 3. Review patch
git apply --check patch.diff
git apply --stat patch.diff

# 4. Test patch
make C=1 CHECK=sparse
make coccicheck
```

**Where**: Code review is essential in:

- **Kernel development** - All kernel development projects
- **Driver development** - Device driver development
- **Open source projects** - Community-driven development
- **Team development** - Collaborative development
- **Rock 5B+** - ARM64 embedded development

## Code Review Process

**What**: The code review process is a structured approach to reviewing code that ensures consistency and thoroughness.

**Why**: Understanding the code review process is important because:

- **Consistency** - Ensures consistent review quality
- **Thoroughness** - Ensures all aspects are reviewed
- **Efficiency** - Makes the review process more efficient
- **Learning** - Provides learning opportunities for reviewers
- **Quality** - Improves overall code quality

**How**: The code review process involves:

```bash
# Example: Code review process
# 1. Pre-review checklist
# - Code compiles without warnings
# - Code passes static analysis
# - Code follows coding standards

    ptr = kmalloc(1024, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!ptr)
        return -ENOMEM;  // Good: Error handling

    // Check: Are resources properly cleaned up?
    kfree(ptr);
    return 0;
}

// 4. Memory management
static int memory_management_example(void)
{
    void *ptr1, *ptr2;

    // Check: Are all allocations freed?
    ptr1 = kmalloc(1024, GFP_KERNEL);
    ptr2 = kmalloc(2048, GFP_KERNEL);

    if (!ptr1 || !ptr2) {
        // Check: Are all allocations freed on error?
        kfree(ptr1);
        kfree(ptr2);
        return -ENOMEM;
    }

    // Check: Are all allocations freed on success?
    kfree(ptr1);
    kfree(ptr2);
    return 0;
}

// 5. Security considerations
static int security_example(char __user *user_data, size_t len)
{
    char buffer[256];

    // Check: Are user inputs validated?
    if (len > sizeof(buffer))
