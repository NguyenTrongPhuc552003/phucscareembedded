#include <sys/mman.h>

#define GPIO_BASE 0x3F200000  // Raspberry Pi GPIO base address
#define GPIO_SIZE 4096

int main() {
    int fd;
    void *gpio_map;
    volatile unsigned int *gpio;

    // Open /dev/mem for hardware access
    fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Failed to open /dev/mem");
        return -1;
    }

    // Map GPIO registers
    gpio_map = mmap(NULL, GPIO_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, GPIO_BASE);
    if (gpio_map == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("Failed to map GPIO");
        close(fd);
        return -1;
    }

    gpio = (volatile unsigned int *)gpio_map;

    // Configure GPIO pin 18 as output
    *(gpio + 1) |= (1 << 18);

    // Blink LED on GPIO pin 18
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *(gpio + 7) = (1 << 18);   // Set high
        usleep(500000);            // Wait 500ms
        *(gpio + 10) = (1 << 18);  // Set low
        usleep(500000);            // Wait 500ms
    }

    // Cleanup
    munmap(gpio_map, GPIO_SIZE);

echo "Checking application status..."
ssh ${TARGET_USER}@${TARGET_HOST} "ps aux | grep ${APP_NAME}"

# View application logs
echo "Viewing application logs..."
ssh ${TARGET_USER}@${TARGET_HOST} "journalctl -u ${APP_NAME} -n 20"

echo "Deployment and testing complete."
```
