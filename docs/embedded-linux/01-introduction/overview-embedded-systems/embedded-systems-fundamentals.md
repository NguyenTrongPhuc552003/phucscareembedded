void timer_interrupt_handler(void) {
    // Critical section - must complete within deadline
    update_sensor_reading();
    process_control_algorithm();
    update_actuator_output();
    // Handler must complete before next interrupt
}
```

**Explanation**:

    uint16_t sensor_data;  // 2 bytes - sensor readings
    uint8_t counter;       // 1 byte - operation counter
} __attribute__((packed)) system_state_t;  // Total: 4 bytes

// Example: Power management
void enter_sleep_mode(void) {
    // Disable unused peripherals
    disable_unused_peripherals();

    // Configure wake-up sources

    static uint32_t last_reading = 0;
    uint32_t current_time = get_system_time();

    // Read temperature every 100ms
    if (current_time - last_reading >= 100) {
        uint16_t temperature = read_temperature_sensor();

        // Process temperature data
        if (temperature > TEMP_HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
            activate_cooling_system();
        } else if (temperature < TEMP_LOW_THRESHOLD) {
            activate_heating_system();
        }

        // Update display
        update_temperature_display(temperature);

        last_reading = current_time;
    }
}
```
