# Project Requirements Analysis

Master the systematic process of gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements for embedded Linux projects with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What is Project Requirements Analysis?

**What**: Project requirements analysis is the systematic process of gathering, documenting, and analyzing the functional and non-functional requirements for an embedded Linux project. It involves understanding stakeholder needs, defining system boundaries, and establishing clear criteria for project success.

**Why**: Requirements analysis is crucial because:

- **Foundation for design** - Provides clear direction for system architecture
- **Stakeholder alignment** - Ensures all parties have shared understanding
- **Risk mitigation** - Identifies potential challenges early
- **Quality assurance** - Establishes measurable success criteria
- **Cost control** - Prevents scope creep and feature bloat

**When**: Requirements analysis should be performed when:

- **Project initiation** - Before any design work begins
- **Stakeholder meetings** - During initial project discussions
- **Scope changes** - When project requirements evolve
- **Design reviews** - Before major architectural decisions
- **Risk assessments** - When evaluating project feasibility

**How**: Requirements analysis is conducted through:

- **Stakeholder interviews** - Gathering needs from all parties
- **Use case analysis** - Defining system behavior scenarios
- **Documentation review** - Analyzing existing specifications
- **Prototype validation** - Testing requirements with prototypes

### Functional Requirements

**What**: Functional requirements define what the system must do - the specific behaviors and capabilities it must provide.

**Why**: Functional requirements are essential because:

- **System behavior** - Defines what the system does
- **User expectations** - Specifies how users interact with the system
- **Development guidance** - Provides clear implementation targets
- **Testing criteria** - Establishes what must be tested
- **Acceptance criteria** - Defines when the system is complete

**How**: Functional requirements are documented through:

```c
// Example: Functional requirement specification
typedef struct {
    char req_id[20];
    char title[100];
    char description[500];
    char priority[20];
    char source[50];
    char acceptance_criteria[300];
} functional_requirement;

functional_requirement func_reqs[] = {
    {

    char comments[500];
} requirement_validation;

int validate_requirement(requirement_validation *val) {
    int score = 0;

    if (val->is_clear) score++;
    if (val->is_measurable) score++;
    if (val->is_testable) score++;
    if (val->is_feasible) score++;
    if (val->is_necessary) score++;

    printf("Requirement %s validation score: %d/5\n", val->req_id, score);

    if (score >= 4) {
        printf("✓ Requirement is valid\n");
        return 1;
    } else {
        printf("✗ Requirement needs improvement\n");
        printf("Comments: %s\n", val->comments);
        return 0;
    }
}

// Example validation process
void validate_all_requirements() {
    requirement_validation validations[] = {
        {"FR-001", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, "Clear, measurable, and feasible"},
        {"FR-002", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, "Well-defined security requirement"},
        {"FR-003", 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, "Needs clearer definition of 'user-friendly'"},
        {"NFR-001", 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, "Good performance requirement"},
        {"NFR-002", 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, "May not be feasible with current hardware"}
    };

    int valid_count = 0;
    int total_count = sizeof(validations) / sizeof(validations[0]);

    for (int i = 0; i < total_count; i++) {
        if (validate_requirement(&validations[i])) {
            valid_count++;
        }

    SHOULD_HAVE,
    COULD_HAVE,
    WONT_HAVE
} priority_level;

typedef struct {
    char req_id[20];
    char title[100];
    priority_level priority;
    int business_value;  // 1-5 scale
    int technical_risk;  // 1-5 scale
    int effort_estimate; // person-days
} requirement_priority;

requirement_priority prioritized_reqs[] = {
    {"FR-001", "Real-time Data Processing", MUST_HAVE, 5, 3, 20},
    {"FR-002", "Secure Communication", MUST_HAVE, 5, 4, 15},
    {"FR-003", "Web Interface", SHOULD_HAVE, 4, 2, 25},
    {"FR-004", "Mobile App", COULD_HAVE, 3, 3, 30},
    {"FR-005", "Advanced Analytics", WONT_HAVE, 2, 5, 40}
};
```

### Validate Early and Often

**What**: Continuously validate requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

**Why**: Early and frequent validation is important because:

- **Schedule adherence** - Prevents project delays
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** - Ensures needs are met
- **Professional reputation** - Maintains credibility

### Vague Requirements

**What**: Requirements that are ambiguous, unclear, or open to interpretation.

**Why**: Vague requirements are problematic because:

- **Misunderstanding** - Different people interpret them differently
- **Implementation errors** - Developers may build the wrong thing
- **Testing difficulties** - Unclear what to test
- **Stakeholder dissatisfaction** - System doesn't meet expectations
- **Project delays** - Time spent clarifying requirements

**How**: Avoid vague requirements:

```c
// Example: Vague vs. Clear requirements
typedef struct {
    char vague_req[200];
    char clear_req[200];
    char improvement[200];
} requirement_clarity;

requirement_clarity clarity_examples[] = {
    {
        "The system should be user-friendly",
        "The system shall provide a web interface with menu navigation, form validation, and help text",
        "Specify user interface elements and behavior"
    },
    {
        "The system should be fast",
        "The system shall process sensor data within 10ms (95th percentile)",
        "Define measurable performance criteria"
    },
    {
        "The system should be secure",
        "The system shall use TLS 1.3 encryption for all network communication and implement role-based access control",
        "Specify security mechanisms and standards"
    }
};
```

### Scope Creep

**What**: The tendency for project scope to expand beyond original requirements.

**Why**: Scope creep is problematic because:

- **Cost overruns** - Additional features increase development cost
- **Schedule delays** - More work takes more time
- **Resource strain** - Team capacity may be exceeded
- **Quality issues** - Rushing to add features may reduce quality
- **Stakeholder confusion** - Unclear what's included

**How**: Prevent scope creep:

```c
// Example: Scope management
typedef struct {
    char feature[100];
    char original_scope[200];
    char change_request[200];
    char impact_assessment[300];
    char decision[100];
} scope_change;

scope_change scope_changes[] = {
    {
        "Mobile App",
        "Web interface only",
        "Add mobile app for field technicians",
        "Additional 30 person-days, $50K cost, 2-month delay",
        "Rejected - out of scope"
    },
    {
        "Advanced Analytics",
        "Basic data logging",
        "Add machine learning for predictive maintenance",
        "Additional 60 person-days, $100K cost, 4-month delay",
        "Deferred to Phase 2"
