# System Architecture Design

Master the process of designing comprehensive system architecture for embedded Linux projects with comprehensive explanations using the 4W+H framework.

## What is System Architecture Design?

**What**: System architecture design is the process of defining the high-level structure, components, and relationships of an embedded Linux system. It involves making fundamental design decisions about how the system will be organized, how components will interact, and how the system will meet its functional and non-functional requirements.

**Why**: System architecture design is crucial because:

- **Foundation for implementation** - Provides clear guidance for development teams
- **Quality assurance** - Ensures system meets non-functional requirements
- **Risk mitigation** - Identifies technical risks early
- **Scalability planning** - Enables system growth and modification
- **Integration guidance** - Shows how components work together

**When**: System architecture design should be performed when:

- **After requirements analysis** - When requirements are well understood
- **Before detailed design** - Before diving into implementation details
- **During design reviews** - When validating design decisions
- **When requirements change** - When adapting to new requirements
- **Before major milestones** - Before committing to implementation

**How**: System architecture design is conducted through:

- **Architectural patterns** - Using proven design patterns
- **Component decomposition** - Breaking system into manageable parts
- **Interface definition** - Specifying how components communicate
- **Quality attribute analysis** - Ensuring non-functional requirements are met
- **Technology selection** - Choosing appropriate tools and platforms

**Where**: System architecture design is used in:

- **Embedded product development** - Consumer and industrial devices
- **System integration projects** - Combining multiple embedded systems
- **Legacy system modernization** - Upgrading existing systems
- **Research and development** - Exploring new embedded technologies
- **Custom solutions** - Developing specialized embedded applications

## Architectural Patterns for Embedded Linux

**What**: Architectural patterns are proven solutions to common design problems in embedded systems, providing templates for organizing system components.

**Why**: Using architectural patterns is important because:

- **Proven solutions** - Patterns are tested and validated approaches
- **Design guidance** - Provide structure for organizing components
- **Best practices** - Incorporate industry best practices
- **Communication** - Common vocabulary for discussing designs
- **Reusability** - Can be applied across different projects

### Layered Architecture

**What**: Layered architecture organizes system components into horizontal layers, where each layer provides services to the layer above and uses services from the layer below.

**Why**: Layered architecture is beneficial because:

- **Separation of concerns** - Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Modularity** - Layers can be developed and tested independently
- **Maintainability** - Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Reusability** - Layers can be reused in different contexts
- **Abstraction** - Higher layers don't need to know implementation details

**How**: Layered architecture is implemented through:

```c
// Example: Layered architecture for embedded Linux
typedef struct {
    char layer_name[50];
    char responsibility[200];
    char interfaces[300];
    char dependencies[200];
} architecture_layer;

architecture_layer layers[] = {
    {
        "Application Layer",
        "Business logic and user interfaces",
        "REST API, Web UI, Command Line",
        "Service Layer"
    },
    {
        "Service Layer",
        "Core business services and orchestration",
        "Service APIs, Event Bus",
        "Data Access Layer"
    },
    {
        "Data Access Layer",
        "Data persistence and retrieval",
        "Database APIs, File System APIs",
        "Hardware Abstraction Layer"
    },
    {
        "Hardware Abstraction Layer",
        "Hardware interface abstraction",
        "GPIO APIs, UART APIs, I2C APIs",
        "Kernel Drivers"
    },
    {
        "Kernel Drivers",
        "Low-level hardware drivers",
        "Kernel APIs, Device Files",
        "Hardware"
    }
};

// Example: Layer interaction
void application_layer_task(void) {
    // Application layer calls service layer
    sensor_data_t data = service_layer_read_sensor();
    control_output_t output = service_layer_process_data(data);
    service_layer_update_actuator(output);
}

void service_layer_read_sensor(void) {
    // Service layer calls data access layer
    raw_data_t raw = data_access_read_sensor();
    return data_access_process_sensor_data(raw);
}

void data_access_read_sensor(void) {
    // Data access layer calls hardware abstraction
    return hal_read_sensor_register(SENSOR_DATA_REG);
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **Application Layer** - Implements user-facing functionality
- **Service Layer** - Provides business logic and orchestration
- **Data Access Layer** - Handles data persistence and retrieval
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer** - Abstracts hardware interfaces
- **Kernel Drivers** - Low-level hardware interaction

**Where**: Layered architecture is used in:

- **Complex embedded systems** - Systems with multiple functions
- **User-interactive systems** - Devices with displays and interfaces
- **Data-intensive applications** - Systems that process large amounts of data
- **Maintainable systems** - Projects requiring long-term maintenance
- **Team development** - Projects with multiple developers

### Microservices Architecture

**What**: Microservices architecture decomposes the system into small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

**Why**: Microservices architecture is valuable because:

- **Independent deployment** - Services can be updated independently
- **Technology diversity** - Different services can use different technologies
- **Scalability** - Services can be scaled independently
- **Fault isolation** - Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Team autonomy** - Different teams can work on different services

**How**: Microservices are implemented through:

```c
// Example: Microservices for embedded Linux
typedef struct {
    char service_name[50];
    char responsibility[200];
    char api_endpoints[300];
    char data_store[100];
    char communication[200];
} microservice;

microservice services[] = {
    {
        "Sensor Service",
        "Collect and process sensor data",
        "GET /sensors, POST /data, GET /status",
        "Time-series Database",
        "MQTT, REST API"
    },
    {
        "Alarm Service",
        "Manage alarms and notifications",
        "GET /alarms, POST /alerts, PUT /acknowledge",
        "Redis Cache",
        "REST API, WebSocket"
    },
    {
        "Config Service",
        "System configuration management",
        "GET /config, PUT /config, POST /backup",
        "SQLite Database",
        "REST API"
    },
    {
        "Auth Service",
        "Authentication and authorization",
        "POST /login, POST /token, GET /validate",
        "PostgreSQL",
        "JWT, OAuth2"
    }
};

// Example: Service communication
typedef struct {
    char service_id[20];
    char endpoint[100];
    char method[10];
    char payload[500];
    char response[500];
} service_request;

void sensor_service_process_data(service_request *req) {
    // Process sensor data
    sensor_data_t data = parse_sensor_data(req->payload);
    processed_data_t processed = process_sensor_reading(data);

    // Store data
    store_sensor_data(processed);

    // Check for alarms
    if (processed.value > ALARM_THRESHOLD) {
        service_request alarm_req = {
            "alarm-service",
            "/alarms",
            "POST",
            format_alarm_data(processed),
            ""
        };
        send_service_request(&alarm_req);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **Service independence** - Each service operates independently
- **API communication** - Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- **Data isolation** - Each service manages its own data
- **Event-driven** - Services can trigger events in other services
- **Scalable design** - Services can be scaled based on demand

**Where**: Microservices architecture is used in:

- **Large embedded systems** - Complex systems with many functions
- **Distributed systems** - Systems spread across multiple devices
- **Cloud-connected devices** - IoT devices with cloud integration
- **Team-based development** - Projects with multiple development teams
- **Evolving systems** - Systems that need to change frequently

## Component Design and Integration

**What**: Component design involves defining individual system components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.

**Why**: Component design is important because:

- **Modularity** - Enables independent development and testing
- **Reusability** - Components can be reused across projects
- **Maintainability** - Easier to modify and update individual components
- **Team coordination** - Different teams can work on different components
- **Quality assurance** - Components can be tested independently

### Component Interface Design

```c
// Example: Component interface design
typedef struct {
    char component_name[50];
    char provided_interface[200];
    char required_interface[200];
    char data_flow[300];
    char error_handling[200];
} component_interface;

component_interface components[] = {
    {
        "Sensor Manager",
        "read_sensor(), configure_sensor(), get_sensor_status()",
        "GPIO APIs, I2C APIs, UART APIs",
        "Hardware -> Sensor Manager -> Data Buffer",
        "Retry on failure, log errors, fallback values"
    },
    {
        "Data Processor",
        "process_data(), validate_data(), transform_data()",
        "Data Buffer APIs, Configuration APIs",
        "Data Buffer -> Data Processor -> Processed Data",

        "Processed Data APIs, Notification APIs",
        "Processed Data -> Alarm Manager -> Alarms",
        "Rate limiting, alarm suppression, escalation"
    }
};

// Example: Component implementation
typedef struct {
    sensor_config_t config;
    data_buffer_t *buffer;
    error_handler_t error_handler;
} sensor_manager_t;

int sensor_manager_init(sensor_manager_t *manager, sensor_config_t *config) {
    manager->config = *config;
    manager->buffer = data_buffer_create(1000);
    manager->error_handler = error_handler_create();

    if (!manager->buffer || !manager->error_handler) {
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}

int sensor_manager_read_sensor(sensor_manager_t *manager, sensor_id_t id, sensor_data_t *data) {
    int retry_count = 0;
    int result;

    while (retry_count < MAX_RETRIES) {
        result = hal_read_sensor(id, data);
        if (result == 0) {
            data_buffer_write(manager->buffer, data);
            return 0;
        }

        retry_count++;
        error_handler_log_error(manager->error_handler, "Sensor read failed", result);
        usleep(RETRY_DELAY_MS * 1000);
    }

    return -1;
}
```

    manager->flow_count = 0;
    manager->processor = data_processor_create();
    manager->queue = message_queue_create(1000);

    if (!manager->flows || !manager->processor || !manager->queue) {
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}

int data_flow_manager_add_flow(data_flow_manager_t *manager, data_flow *flow) {
    if (manager->flow_count >= MAX_FLOWS) {
        return -1;
    }

    manager->flows[manager->flow_count] = *flow;
    manager->flow_count++;

    return 0;
}

void data_flow_manager_process_data(data_flow_manager_t *manager, char *data, int data_size) {
    // Process data according to flow configuration
    for (int i = 0; i < manager->flow_count; i++) {
        data_flow *flow = &manager->flows[i];

        if (strcmp(flow->data_type, "Sensor Data") == 0) {
            data_processor_process_sensor_data(manager->processor, data, data_size);
        } else if (strcmp(flow->data_type, "Alarm Events") == 0) {
            data_processor_process_alarm_data(manager->processor, data, data_size);
        }
    }
}
```
