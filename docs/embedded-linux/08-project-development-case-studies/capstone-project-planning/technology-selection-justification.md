    }
};

void evaluate_frameworks(framework_option *frameworks, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        // Calculate weighted total score
        frameworks[i].total_score = (frameworks[i].performance * 0.2) +
                                   (frameworks[i].ease_of_use * 0.15) +
                                   (frameworks[i].documentation * 0.15) +
                                   (frameworks[i].community_support * 0.15) +
                                   (frameworks[i].license_compatibility * 0.15) +
                                   (frameworks[i].feature_completeness * 0.2);
