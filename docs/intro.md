# Welcome to Embedded Development

Welcome to Phuc's comprehensive guide for embedded Linux, Linux kernel development, and GPU development! This documentation covers everything you need to know about developing for embedded systems, with a focus on the Rock 5B+ development board.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers:

- **Linux Kernel Development**: Master kernel architecture, process management, memory management, device drivers, real-time systems, and advanced kernel topics
- **Embedded Linux Development**: Kernel development, device drivers, and system programming
- **GPU Programming**: Mali GPU development, OpenCL, and Vulkan programming
- **Rust Programming**: Complete Rust programming guide from basics to embedded systems
- **Yocto Project**: Building custom Linux distributions
- **Rock 5B+ Setup**: Hardware configuration and development environment

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Understanding of programming concepts (C programming recommended for kernel development)
- Familiarity with version control (Git)
- Rock 5B+ development board (recommended)
- Basic understanding of computer architecture (for kernel development)

## Development Environment

We'll set up a complete development environment including:

- Cross-compilation toolchains for ARM64
- Kernel development tools and debugging (GDB, KGDB, OpenOCD)
- Real-time Linux development environment
- Development boards and peripherals
- Version control and CI/CD pipelines
