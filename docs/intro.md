# Welcome to Embedded Development

Welcome to Phuc's comprehensive guide for computer architecture, Linux kernel development, Rust programming, and embedded Linux development! This documentation covers everything you need to know about developing for embedded systems, with a focus on the Rock 5B+ development board.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers:

### Computer Architecture

- **Hardware Fundamentals**: Digital logic, combinational/sequential circuits, and computer organization
- **ARM64 ISA**: Instruction set architecture, addressing modes, assembly programming, and SIMD/NEON
- **Processor Design**: Pipelining, superscalar execution, branch prediction, and Cortex-A76/A55 microarchitecture
- **System Architecture**: Memory hierarchy, cache optimization, multi-core systems, I/O, GPU/NPU, and performance tuning

### Linux Kernel Development

- **Kernel Fundamentals**: Architecture, process/memory management, system calls, and ARM64 specifics
- **Device Drivers**: Character devices, platform drivers, DMA, interrupts, and power management
- **Real-Time Systems**: PREEMPT_RT kernel, scheduling policies, latency optimization, and real-time applications
- **Advanced Topics**: Synchronization, security hardening, performance optimization, and kernel contribution

### Rust Programming

- **Core Concepts**: Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and memory safety without garbage collection
- **Systems Programming**: Unsafe Rust, FFI, concurrency primitives, and async programming
- **Embedded Development**: no_std programming, bare-metal development, and hardware abstraction layers
- **Testing & Optimization**: Unit testing, profiling, benchmarking, and production applications

### Embedded Linux Development

- **System Fundamentals**: Linux architecture, cross-compilation, device drivers, and kernel development
- **Build Systems**: U-Boot bootloader, Buildroot, Yocto Project, and custom image creation
- **Networking & Protocols**: Socket programming, I2C/SPI/UART, CAN bus, and industrial protocols
- **Production Deployment**: Real-time optimization, security hardening, debugging, and case studies

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Understanding of programming concepts (C programming recommended for kernel development)
- Familiarity with version control (Git)
- Rock 5B+ development board (recommended)
- Basic understanding of computer architecture (for kernel development)

## Development Environment

We'll set up a complete development environment including:

- Cross-compilation toolchains for ARM64
- Kernel development tools and debugging (GDB, KGDB, OpenOCD)
- Real-time Linux development environment
- Development boards and peripherals
- Version control and CI/CD pipelines
